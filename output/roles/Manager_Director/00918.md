Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to review and edit professional writing like emails and proposals, as well as training materials being developed.  I also look for ideas - appropriate images for training content that may more creatively represent the concepts, fun examples or scenarios to illustrate points, and the like.  If I'm unsure about definitions or models, I confirm with AI and when learning something new myself, I try to get the gist of topic and key words, concepts, and resources to research.

AI: That's a really interesting range of uses. It sounds like you're using AI both for polishing work you've already done and for creative brainstorming.

When you say you use AI to "confirm" definitions or models when you're unsure - can you tell me more about that process? What does that look like for you?

User: The training materials I write are for project management and there is a lot of specific terminology with distinct definitions that cause a lot of confusion in related processes if not used correctly.  A simple example of something a lot of people confuse is quality control vs. quality assurance.  If I find myself feeling unsure - I will double check with AI.  The same is true for the specifics of models - for example management models like Belbin vs. Magerison - or the specific wording of process steps.  I am an expert but don't want to lose credibility by slipping up because I'm tired or distracted...

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a safety net to maintain your professional credibility, especially when dealing with precise terminology that can have real consequences if used incorrectly.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I generally write the first draft of everything and then ask AI for help editing.  This is to set the tone for the document and prevent having to fact check everything in an initial draft created by AI.  I also like to layout slide content myself.  I guess I have a personal style of writing training materials and delivering them that is distinct from the standard approach.  It is more work to explain what I want then to just do it myself.  I also do deep research on topics I need to learn before incorporating them myself - I guess I don't trust AI to present the most relevant information or get it all correct.  (For example, when I was learning about ITIL - I got back information with terminology, process steps, etc. that were a mix of 2 different versions of ITIL.  Only when I queried this, did the model acknowledge that were different verions.)

AI: That ITIL example is really telling - it sounds like you discovered AI can blend information from different versions without flagging that distinction, which could be misleading when precision matters.

When you do use AI for editing after writing your first draft, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the editing process, or do you tend to give it the draft and let it handle the editing independently?

User: I write materials for UK students, and often have an issue with models acknowledging that but then using some distinctly US spellings.  I also frequently nudge it to get to the correct tone or verbosity etc.  What frustrates me most is when we go back and forth and AI makes edits, I make a new request about the same material, and the model re-edits its own work again with reason - sometimes reverting to my original draft as if it was an improvement.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - the inconsistency where AI essentially undoes its own work and treats your original version as an improvement must make the collaboration feel unreliable.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself using it differently based on your work environment?

User: I am a freelancer, so no.

AI: Got it - being a freelancer certainly gives you complete control over how you integrate AI into your workflow.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was writing e-learning content and relied heavily on AI to help me come up with creative themes for images to represent process steps.  This save me so much time sifting through thousands of stock images and I received a lot of compliments for making the content more interesting than the blue and white technical stock images that are used over and over in training.

AI: That's a great example of AI helping you add creative value that got recognized! It sounds like you found a sweet spot where AI could generate ideas you might not have thought of, but you still maintained control over the final selection and implementation.

On the flip side, you mentioned some frustrations earlier with the editing inconsistencies. Beyond that ITIL version mixing and the back-and-forth editing issues, have there been other particularly frustrating moments when using AI for work?

User: I once asked for example data to illustrate NPV.  The model provided data that did not incorporate that costs as requested.  I asked for correction - it acknowledged it had messed up - then provided the exact same table of data.  We went back and forth like this several rounds until I gave up.  It was worse than arguing with my husband!

AI: Ha! That comparison really captures the frustration - especially when AI keeps acknowledging the error but then repeats it anyway. That must have felt particularly maddening when you needed accurate financial data for training materials.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I would - suggestions?

AI: Actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this first. When you think about the areas where you're currently using AI - like editing, creative brainstorming for images, or checking definitions - do you worry about any of those skills getting rusty? Or are there other areas where you think "I should make sure I don't lose this ability"?

User: I think I am getting better at it - wording question and giving more precise directions to get what I need in fewer rounds.  I use it enough that I don't worry about losing it.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're viewing AI as a skill to develop rather than something that might replace your existing abilities. You're getting better at the collaboration itself.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as you continue to refine those prompting skills?

User: I would like to be able to use it more for creating 1st drafts as that is time-consuming, but would have to trust it more.  I guess I currently consider it to a junior employee in training that requires micro-management...I will only feel comfortable giving it more responsibility when it consistently proves it doesn't need me to check every word!

AI: That junior employee analogy is really insightful - the need to micromanage because you can't fully trust the output quality yet, but with the hope that it might eventually earn more independence.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI sometimes acts inconsistently with its own edits, and that great analogy about it being like a junior employee that needs micromanagement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the trust-building process with AI, the creative applications you've found, and especially those specific examples of where AI falls short have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
