Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Hmm, that is a difficult question. I feel like 'project' is too strong a word, as I am only a student researcher. I can walk you through I guess an 'instance' of research though. Without getting too bogged down in the details, sometimes in my research I will have to work out some combinatorial quantity as a function of n, where n is number of objects, number of moves, etc. After I have first established the problem I actually need to solve, if the answer is not immediately obvious, I then will ask some AI model to write me a script to generate values of this function for different n. I have to verify a few of these values by hand though usually, as the AI often makes a mistake, but once I have checked 3 or so, I usually have faith in the AI. Then I spend a little while trying to 'spot' a formula based on these numbers. Once I do that, I will try and prove/derive the formula. I try and do this without any AI, because one, it's more satisfying, and two, if it's not so easy that I can derive it straight away, the AI normally gets it wrong. Then once I have proven this, I am done.

I guess this wasn't a great example, so I will also talk about my data science research. Recently, I had a large data set of crop growth patterns of a wide variety of crops under different weather conditions, different locations, different soil conditions, different planting timings, different sun exposures, etc.. While it is already very well documented how each of these individually affect plant growth, I was looking at how these conflating factors may affect one another (ie sun could be a negative sometimes for a sun loving crop because it might dry out the soil in certain soil conditions). I started by just doing some simple regressions of one variable against another, trying and hold some variables fixed etc.. Eventually, I got an AI to write me a random forrest model, which allowed me to test certain extreme conditions that may not have appeared in the data set. From this, it made it easier for me to come up with a couple conjectures like the one I stated before, which I proved or disproved by having a more focused analysis on the area that relates to the idea.

AI: Those are really helpful examples - thank you for walking me through both of those. I can see how different types of research problems call for different approaches.

Let me focus on that data science example with the crop growth patterns. When you got to the point of having the AI write the random forest model for you, tell me about how you decided to use AI for that specific task rather than coding it yourself or using some other approach.

User: Common ML models like random forrest, XGBoost, etc. have lots of documentation on the internet, which means the AI can do a very good job, as it is essentially creating the algorithm by reading instructions, so the quality is very high. As for why I didn't do it myself, AI can just do it much quicker, especially since I am not very familiar with the ins and outs of random forrest, I just knew it would be good for this situation. If I were making it myself I would probably be reading the same documentation anyway, which I would do much slower than AI.

As for why I chose to use random forrest, just I heard from some of my friends that it is very good for high dimensional data sets.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - leveraging the AI's ability to quickly synthesize well-documented approaches. 

I'm curious about the verification step you mentioned. You said you usually verify a few values by hand when the AI generates combinatorial scripts, but for the random forest model, how did you go about checking or validating what the AI produced there?

User: Well along with being able to plug in outlier/extreme conditions into the random forrest model, you can also just plug in a data point from your data set. What I did was I chose a few points that were very 'standard' data points, in that they were very well fit by the regression models I got earlier, subbed in the conditions that gave those data points into the random forrest model, and made sure its output was very similar to the actual data point.
Also I realised I didn't clarify what the output is, the output is crop yield.

AI: That's a smart validation approach - using the data points that your simpler regression models handled well as benchmarks. 

Thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't used AI - like when you mentioned preferring to derive the combinatorial formulas yourself, or doing the initial exploratory regressions - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: For the maths, either I could've done it by AI, in which case it only takes me a few minutes anyway, and I mildly enjoy the proof and derivation process so I just do it myself, or if the AI can't do it, the reason I do it myself is fairly self explanatory.
For the data science, you are probably right that I could get it to do the regressions, but kinda a similar story, to do it myself it maybe takes a bit longer, but under 15 minutes say, and after I have to spend the time verifying the AI output, it basically ends up being the same time.

AI: That time trade-off makes perfect sense - especially when the verification step can eat into any time savings. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask about something forward-looking: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: I speak about the data science example more here. At least the way AI is integrated into my work flows, the AI can model the data, but the AI has absolutely no ability to interpret the data. It would be great if it could create the random forrest model AND then use that model to come up with some reasonable conjectures about patterns in the data.

AI: That's a really insightful point - the gap between modeling and interpretation. It sounds like you're saying the AI can execute the technical modeling well, but it can't make the conceptual leaps to identify meaningful patterns or generate hypotheses about what the data might be revealing.

When you were looking at those crop yield results and forming conjectures about things like sun exposure sometimes being negative due to soil drying effects - was that purely your own pattern recognition, or did you try asking the AI to help interpret what the model was showing?

User: There was no AI used after making the model. In terms of that particular example, more how I came up with it was intuitively that was something that could reasonably happen based on my understanding of how plants grew, so that was a place to start for a pattern to look for.

AI: I see - so your domain knowledge about plant biology guided where you looked for patterns, rather than just letting the data speak for itself. That's really valuable context.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI fits into the technical execution parts of your workflow while you handle the conceptual and interpretive work were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Okay it would be slightly misleading to say I have 'domain knowledge' in plant biology. I was just the R monkey interpreting the data. I don't think you need to be a plant biology expert to realise that in some cases water and sun can be conflicting objectives.

AI: Ha, fair point - that's more just basic intuition than specialized expertise! Thanks for the clarification.

Is there anything else about how you use AI in your research, or how you think about it, that we haven't covered but might be important for us to understand?
