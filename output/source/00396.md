Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. We can begin.

AI: Great, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I might use AI to organize lists of ICD-10 codes for easy reference. For example, I might provide a list of my most commonly used codes and ask AI to organize them alphbetically. Or, I have input a list of codes and asked AI how frequently each one is being used in a particular month.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you work in healthcare or medical coding. 

Tell me more about how you approach these coding tasks with AI. When you're working with those ICD-10 codes, what does that process typically look like from start to finish?

User: I have to read each medical provider's note on a patient to ensure that the documentation matches the diagnosis. Or, if a diagnonsis is unclear, I have to reach out to the provider for clarification. Once I have the accuarate diagnosis, I record it next to the patient encounter on a spreadsheet that is generated by the electronic health record. I frequently need to consult the ICD-10 coding guide and CMS regualtions to ensure each enounter is coded correctly. Once I have reviewed all enounters for the month and added/corrected any entries, I then submit the report to the billing department.

AI: So it sounds like the core diagnostic work - reading the provider notes, determining if documentation matches the diagnosis, reaching out for clarification - that's all work you handle yourself. 

When you bring AI into this process, like organizing those code lists or analyzing frequency, what made you decide to use AI for those particular pieces rather than doing them manually?

User: I will typically code for aorund 150 patients a month. Each patient is seen at least twice a week. This leads to a large number of enounters. It is easier for AI to count the number of a particlar diagnosis as opposed to me counting them myself. Using AI for this also helps me to look for patterns in diagnoses being duplicated. If I see a large number of a common diagnosis (e.g., constipation), this tells me I need to review the notes again becuse it is uncommon for a person to need care for this condition so frequenty. Most likely the patient was seen for something else in that encounter that was not recorded in the electronic health record.

AI: That's a really insightful use case - using AI as a quality control tool to spot patterns that might indicate coding errors. 

When you discover those patterns, like an unusually high frequency of constipation diagnoses, and realize you need to go back and review those notes again - how do you feel about that process? Is it satisfying to catch those potential errors, or more frustrating to have the additional work?

User: It definitely satisfies my inner perfectionist, but it is also frustrasting to have to check the work of an electronic health record which was supposedly built to record the diagnosis of each patient within the note. The health record does not always record the right diagnosis, expsically in people with multiple health concerns, and therefore more diagnoses. It seems to run out of room and only record some of the diagnoses, but not others.

AI: That tension you describe is really interesting - the satisfaction of catching errors but frustration with having to work around system limitations. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain parts of your coding work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I would prefer that AI handle all of it, and I could check samples to make sure it is all working smoothly. The issue is that the notes sometimes contain protected health information such as namesand other PII, and this could potentially violate confidentiality. So I only utilize AI for tasks where no confidnetial information is dislcosed.

AI: That's a really important constraint - the confidentiality requirements clearly shape how you can and can't use AI in your work.

When you do use AI for those tasks where you can share information safely, like organizing codes or analyzing patterns, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with AI, refining the analysis together, or do you tend to give it a complete task and let it handle it independently?

User: Sometimes. I may enter a snippet of my spreadsheet and ask it to give me a list of diagnoses. Then, I'll also ask which provider made the diagnosis and on what date. This helps me to spot if a particular provider entered an incorrect diagnosis or simply duplicated a diagnosis from a previous enounter. So sometimes I'll ask for a straightforward answer, and other times I'll ask for addtional information, which has suprisingly helped me fine-tune my pattern recognition abilites.

AI: It sounds like AI has actually helped sharpen your own analytical skills - that's fascinating. You mentioned it's helped fine-tune your pattern recognition abilities.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others in your field talk about using AI for similar tasks, or are you more of a pioneer in this area?

User: I am more of a pioneer in that aspect in my department. I work for a state hospital, and the state where I live has only recently began warming up to the idea of AI to automate tasks. A couple years ago, AI was strictly prohibited, but they are starting to use it more for HR/hiring and tasks requiring analysis.

AI: That shift from prohibition to gradual acceptance must have been quite a journey to witness and navigate.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think being able to share my ability to utilize AI and show others how easy It can be is really satifiying because I lilke seeing other people perform more efficiently and I like making their jobs easier.

AI: That's really generous - finding satisfaction in helping others work more efficiently. It sounds like you've become something of an AI advocate in your workplace.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? You mentioned you'd prefer AI handle all the coding tasks if confidentiality weren't an issue - is this something you actively consider?

User: I would still manually review the work for accuracy because no one, human or automated, is perfect. There should always be a second set of eyes to make sure work products are as accuate as possible. AI would allow me to organize and review it more quickly. Only so many things can go wrong with medical coding, and I'm pretty confident in my ability to spot them.

AI: That confidence in your ability to spot errors really comes through - it sounds like you see AI as enhancing rather than replacing your expertise.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you think this is all heading for someone in your field?

User: I would like to see AI common for tasks that can be automated. A lot of my work still involves paper, and some things I do can't be automated. Plus, my work involves healthcare (and making sure we get paid for our services), so there will always be a need for people like me. This will allow me to focus more on time-consuming tasks that I need to do manually, and streamlining others to improve efficiency.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a quality control tool to spot diagnostic patterns and how you've become an advocate for helping others in your department work more efficiently.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all I have. I've enjoyed this interview.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating confidentiality constraints, using AI for quality control, and gradually introducing colleagues to these tools will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you were in describing your work - it's clear you've found some creative and practical ways to integrate AI while maintaining the high standards your field requires. Take care!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day.
