Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: My work involves editing and transcribing medical documents which includes a lot of fact checking.   When I have a hard time finding what I'm looking for in Google, I will use a chatbot to help.  I find that chatting about the problem usually either leads to the answer I'm looking for, which I can then go double check, or it helps clarify how to word my search for Google or specifically what to look for in the medical records.

AI: That's really interesting how you use it as a bridge to help clarify your thinking and search strategy. 

Tell me more about that process - when you say you "chat about the problem," what does that conversation typically look like?

User: For example, if there is a dictated word that I can't figure out or a medication name that is cut off in the dictation, I look at the rest of the document to see if I can find some clues, often in the form symptoms.  I can then ask a chatbot about which diseases have those symptoms that start with something that sounds like "dis" and through the conversation, I can usually narrow down the word I am looking for.  I can then go double check that with Google or reference books.

AI: That's a fascinating detective-like process you've developed. It sounds like you're using the AI almost like a brainstorming partner to work through these puzzles.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I always check Google first because I can see exactly what site the information is coming from and discern whether it is a reliable source or not.  I also have the medical records available to look through to glean information from when I can't find what I need quickly on Google.  AI is usually my third choice because I don't know if the information is trustworthy (as I don't know the orignal source) and I have to double check everything which takes longer.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you've developed a clear hierarchy based on source reliability and verification time. It sounds like trust and being able to trace information back to its source is really important in your work.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Collaboration.   I will typically ask something like, "are there any diseases that start with a 'dis'-sound that have these symptoms..." and go from there.  Sometimes it takes a couple rounds of back and forth to fine tune and come up with the correct answer.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth approach sounds really effective for your detective work. It's interesting how you use it as a thinking partner rather than asking it to solve the whole puzzle at once.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: There is a bit of AI built in to the program we use for our documents which does speech-to-text and formatting, but as far as I know, I am the only one who uses chatbots to help with the 'detective work'.   It is generally not encouraged because it is not considered a reliable source, which is why I have to double check everything.

AI: So you're kind of pioneering this approach on your own, working within those reliability constraints your workplace has set. That's really thoughtful how you've found a way to use it as a tool while still respecting those standards.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Hmmm, I can't really think of a time that was particularly frustrating.  If I can't find clarity in the first two or three rounds of conversation, I will just stop and try another avenue.  I find it extra satisfying when I'm able to figure out the answer myself as I'm typing the prompt itself.  Sometimes, just the act of writing it out and explaining the issue is enough for the puzzle pieces to fall into the right spots and for me to figure out what I'm looking for.

AI: That's such a great insight - it sounds like the process of articulating the problem to the AI actually helps you think through it, even before you get a response. Like the AI is helping you organize your own thoughts just by giving you a framework to explain the issue.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think about this often.  Already, our department has become smaller and as people retire they are not getting replaced by new hires.  The program we use with the speech-to-text and other advances features are making the work much more efficient and lowering the need for as many workers in my department.  I worry that at some point, they will start transferring people to other departments because there won't be enough work for us.

AI: That's a really honest perspective, and it sounds like you're seeing those changes happening in real time with the department shrinking. That must create some real tension between appreciating the efficiency these tools bring while also worrying about the long-term implications.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I plan on continuing to use the chatbots as I am for now, as a helper for research and fact checking.  If our work were to change and include more writing and less editing, I might consider using AI to help formulate templates or to double check my work before sending it off.

AI: That makes sense - adapting your AI use to match whatever direction your work evolves in. You seem to have a really pragmatic approach to it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the act of explaining a problem to AI can actually help you solve it yourself, and how you've developed that trust hierarchy with your sources.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we're covered it all.  Thank you :)

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative thinking partner while maintaining those important verification standards will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
