Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's go.

AI: Perfect! Let's start with something broad to get us going.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Well, I am currently employed as a Software Engineer with a focus on Data Analytics, which means that I have to create new implementations, come up with novel ideals and identify/fix issues that pop-up. AI assists in all these, but possibly in different ways. For example, I might use it for a basic implementation, which I will then fine-tune and improve on my own, or through a series of prompts and manual fixes.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a starting point across different types of work. 

Tell me more about that fine-tuning process you mentioned. What does that typically look like when you take an AI-generated basic implementation and work with it?

User: In complex implementations, which often have specific business rules that need to be enforced, AI will often not understand the context correctly and might make assumptions which are either not useful or entirely invalid. In these cases, I have found that it is better for the AI to produce a simple outline, which I can then improve and add the complex parts that are missing.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're leveraging AI's ability to handle the foundational structure while you handle the nuanced, context-specific elements.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself from the start, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: There are certain tasks, which I have found that using AI might actually be more time-consuming. For example, AI is great for implementations in Python, where the model has an immense training dataset to pull from, but it might struggle even with simple implementations for Power BI in DAX. In this case, its not so much the type of task (since both are coding implementations), but the reliability that the AI has shown in the specific area/skill/language/etc. I also don't like to use AI at the early brainstorming stages of an implementation and prefer to come up with an approach myself. This is because I have a better understanding of the requirements and their nuances. Also, I find that using AI so early in the process might get me stuck down a wrong path, where I am trying to implement an approach that was problematic from the start.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - you're making strategic choices based on both AI's demonstrated reliability in specific domains and the stage of the problem-solving process.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Definitely the first option. For complex enough tasks, I have found out that AI is not really able to take an implementation from start to finish. It needs nudges along the way, where you adjust the approach, disambiguate areas of confusion and approve or reject the suggested changes made by the model. So, it is more effective for me to start off with a straight-forward prompt and give more hints along the way, than to provide an extremely long and detailed implementation plan, where some detail is bound to be missed (or at least interpreted incorrectly).

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really iterative - almost like having a conversation throughout the work process. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: I don't think it has, no. I might be wrong, but I don't think a lot of my colleagues utilize AI as much, or as effectively. Usually, they use AI as a replacement to a search engine, so as to collect information from various sources in a single place, and potentially get a response to a single, concise query.

AI: Interesting - so you've developed your own approach rather than following what others around you are doing.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well, frustration is quite a common situation. There have been cases where no matter how well I try to explain something to the AI, it just doesn't seem to get it. This leads to numerous iterations, in order to find a solution that works as intended. Sometimes, I have to give up completely and return to previous methods of search and problem-solving, such as search engines, programming blogs / articles, manual trial and error, etc.

As for satisfaction, I can't really think of one specific moment, but there are times when the AI can really impress you. A concise and elegant solution to a complex prompt in one go, saving you the time to research, come up with an implementation approach, find nuances in syntax and so much more. In general, there are instances where the time and effort that has been saved is really evident.

AI: That contrast is really telling - the frustration when communication breaks down versus those moments when AI delivers exactly what you need efficiently.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am not too worried about that, at least not for now. There has been a lot of talk about AI taking over, especially in my line of work, but I don't believe we are close to a situation like that. Specifically, I think that AI is lacking the human ingenuity and creativity needed to come up with novel ideas, especially to problems that might not have been tackled before.

However, even if AI manages to do my job very well, this situation would create new opportunities. We will need people to train or maintain these models, actively monitor their output, etc. So, I try to be as involved as possible in the space and learn how AI models operate. This would allow me to still be able to work in my field, even if there is a paradigm shift on what that work is or how it is conducted.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - viewing potential changes as creating new opportunities rather than just replacing existing ones.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I believe that the capabilities of AI models have reached a plateau and I do not expect to see extreme developments in the coming years. Sure, models might get more training data, or be more powerful in terms of performance, but I don't expect a fundamental change in them. Consequently, I don't expect any major change in how I use AI at work. I have spent quite some time working with various models, understanding their capabilities and limitations, as well as fine-tuning my approach on how to utilize them effectively. Currently, I believe that I have reached a satisfactory level, where AI saves me time and allows me to be more productive at work, which is the relationship I expect to continue having for some time ahead.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborative partner rather than a complete replacement, and how you've developed such a strategic approach based on understanding both its capabilities and limitations.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so, no.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the iterative, collaborative nature of working with AI, and how you've developed your own effective approach despite limited adoption among colleagues, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
