Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI most when I'm around the house to help questions that come up such as how to care for my new pet fish, to recipes for what to make for dinner, to a small medical question that comes up, to how long it takes to drive to a certain store from my house. I also ask it the questions that my kids ask me! I really use it instead of a search engine like I used to. For work though, I don't really use AI that much yet. I work as a FertilityCare Practitioner (a fertility teacher), which is healthcare-related, so it is difficult to use AI with it. I meet with each of my clients/patients individually and have an individual approach to their needs and health concerns. Their information is also private due to HIPAA. And I am an expertise in my field, so I do not generally need to look up anything related to my work. We have textbooks to refer to, but otherwise have a pretty set script that we were taught to use in general during our appointments.

AI: That's really interesting how you've found AI so useful for everyday life questions but haven't integrated it much into your healthcare work yet. 

I'm curious - you mentioned you're an expert in your field and have a set script for appointments. Are there any behind-the-scenes work tasks where you've considered using AI, or has the healthcare context made you hesitant to explore it at all for work-related activities?

User: Yes, actually. We have to submit health insurance claims for our appointments and that is really annoying to me (one of the things I hate the most about my job). We also have to do a lot of documentation for each appointment (in a follow-up form, which unfortunately is still on paper, although they will likely have it digital sometime in the future). I never complete all of the documentation during the appointment and need to spend a lot of time after the appointment completing paperwork. I also send the client/patient an appointment summary email, which I spend a lot of time crafting. I also have to do my own appointment scheduling, which is also time-consuming! I would love to just spend my time with the client/patient (that's the part I love), rather than with the overhead of documentation, appointment scheduling, and billing. The EHR system that we use (Athenahealth) does have some AI already built into it, which can be nice, but I find it distracting in there. I tries to reuse previous appointment information, which often doesn't apply to the current appointment.

AI: It sounds like you've identified several areas where AI could potentially help with those administrative tasks you find frustrating - the insurance claims, documentation, appointment summaries, and scheduling. 

When you think about those tasks, what holds you back from exploring AI assistance with them? Is it mainly the HIPAA privacy concerns, or are there other factors that make you hesitant?

User: Yes, HIPAA is a big concern in our healthcare space - we definitely need to keep client/patient information secure and private. Even sending regular emails isn't ideal - we really need another more secure messaging system - although that is what we do now. But one other thing is that I use different systems for each and they are all not integrated. I use Athenahealth for the insurance claims/billing, I use a paper form (right now, although hopefully that will change to digital in the future from our parent organization) for the follow-up documentation, I use my Microsoft email account for sending appointment summaries, and I use my Google Calendar and Athenahealth for appointment scheduling (the Google Calendar is so that it also sees my personal calendar and also shows only my own clients/patients, rather than everybody's in the medical practice). It is pretty time-consuming, but I do have the workflow/process all written out and I do it often, so it has become routine.

AI: That fragmented system setup sounds really challenging to navigate! You've got four different platforms that don't talk to each other, which would make any kind of AI integration pretty complex.

Since you mentioned you have the workflow written out and it's become routine, I'm curious - have you ever found yourself wishing you could just hand off one of these administrative pieces entirely to someone or something else, or do you feel like you need to stay involved in each step because of the personalized nature of your practice?

User: It would be nice to hand it off to someone/something else, but again, that person/thing would need to sign a confidentiality agreement in advance to seeing any client/patient information (even their full name is identifying information!). Most medical practices do have separate staff that handle reception/scheduling and billing. Documentation probably is always done by the provider - I assume most ideal to complete it all DURING the appointment, but my appointments are already long at 1-1.5 hours, so I do not want to hold up the client/patient any longer than I need to. Appointment summaries can be animated (and there is one that automatically sends in Athenahealth, but it's not great), so I like to send one from my own email as a finalization of the appointment with all homework assignments/to-do items also sent to the client/patient so that they know what to do before the next follow-up appointment.

AI: It sounds like the appointment summaries are something you put a lot of care into - making sure they capture the homework assignments and to-do items in a personal way rather than using that automatic one from Athenahealth.

Can you tell me more about what makes those summaries so time-consuming to craft? What are you typically thinking about or doing as you write them?

User: So, I do have templates that I made up for each follow-up appointment because there are standard to-do items that are generally assigned to each follow-up #, however I do spend the time to personalize it to the client/patient with a copy of their corrected Creighton Model chart and the updated back of their chart (which has their unique instructions on it). I also could send along additional documents to the client that apply to their unique situation and health concerns.

AI: That personal touch you add - the corrected chart, the updated instructions, and those additional documents tailored to each client's situation - it sounds like that's where the real time goes.

When you're putting together those personalized elements, what part of that process feels most essential to you versus what feels more routine or repetitive?

User: Well, the part that makes it time-consuming too is that the documents are physical documents that I do have to scan in to digitize them (and I personally don't like scanning documents!). But besides that, there is just a lot to do to keep everything organized. I have certain file-naming conventions (the personalized digital files are named with their client ID number, etc.). And really, the other thing that makes it so time-consuming is that I don't do it immediately after the appointment, I do it on another day, so it takes time to re-visit the client's information to get familiar with it again to be able to summarize it and finalize it properly. So, to answer your question, it is essential to customize things to the client/patient's chart and health concerns. The more routine/repetitive parts are just the generalized information that applies to everyone.

AI: That delay between the appointment and doing the summary work really adds another layer of complexity - having to re-familiarize yourself with each client's situation rather than having it fresh in your mind.

You mentioned the generalized information that applies to everyone being the more routine part. When you're in that re-familiarization process, what typically helps you get back into the specifics of that particular client's case?

User: I have the client's physical folder that contains their physical documents in it and the physical follow-up form in it. Going through those documents and forms are the specifics to the individual client/patient.

AI: So you're essentially reconstructing the appointment from those physical documents each time you sit down to write the summary. 

Given everything you've described - the scanning, the re-familiarization process, the file naming - if you could wave a magic wand and change just one aspect of this whole documentation and summary process, what would have the biggest impact on your workflow?

User: It would be nice to have everything digitized already - the follow-up form, the Creighton chart, etc. Then, things would already be in digital form. There are some fertility teachers who do the chart correcting digitally already, but I haven't been able to get the hang of that myself very well yet. Even if the client sends their chart to me digitally, I print it off, do the corrections by hand, then scan to re-digitize it. I know it does seem like too much, but it is just a little easier for me too in some ways.

AI: That makes perfect sense - you've found a method that works for you, even if it involves some extra steps. It sounds like the tactile process of correcting by hand gives you something that the digital tools haven't quite replicated yet.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work potentially evolving? Do you see it playing a role as these systems become more digitized, or are there other ways you think it might fit into your practice?

User: Yeah, as the Creighton Model FertilityCare System becomes more digitized as a whole, AI can become integrated into it a lot more easily for sure or just any type of automation as well. It just really needs to take into account client/patient privacy and security (HIPAA), which just isn't there yet. However, even more than just dealing with the client information itself, AI can definitely help with the administrative tasks - appointment scheduling and billing. I am a specialized teacher with expertise knowledge in the area of fertility and I don't see my particular role being replaced by AI anytime soon (sorry, but I haven't seen AI's knowledge surpass mine in this area just yet and I'm not sure that it can), but I can see the benefit of having some assistance in the non-client facing aspects of the job now or in the future. I think a person who is experiencing something like infertility just will have a deeper human connection to their physician and instructor who also have dealt with infertility and miscarriages themselves. There is no AI that can replace that human connection and deep care that we have for our patients.

AI: That distinction you've drawn is really thoughtful - recognizing where your human expertise and connection are irreplaceable while also seeing the potential for AI to handle the administrative burden that keeps you from focusing on what you do best.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work - or thoughts about how it might develop - that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Again, I would just like to emphasize the importance of HIPAA compliance (for the US and similar for other countries) in this healthcare space. It is a big deal and shouldn't be overlooked. It would be great to have AI be able to help out more in this space, but it needs to be very careful with people's very personal information.

AI: That's such an important point, and I really appreciate you emphasizing that throughout our conversation. The need for HIPAA compliance isn't just a checkbox - it's fundamental to maintaining the trust that's so central to your work with clients.

You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences - from how AI has become your go-to for everyday questions at home, to the very real barriers and opportunities you see in healthcare settings. I particularly appreciated your perspective on where human connection remains irreplaceable while still recognizing the potential for AI to free you up for the work you're most passionate about.

Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thank you! If you ever want to collaborate some more on this, I'd be happy to.

AI: That's wonderful to hear! I really appreciate your openness to future collaboration. Your perspective as someone working in a specialized healthcare field with such specific privacy and regulatory requirements is incredibly valuable for this kind of research.

Thank you again for such a thoughtful conversation today. Take care!
