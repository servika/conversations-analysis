Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am an independent consultant for medical device developers and manufacturers and therefore my day-to-day tasks are very diverse. Most of my use centers around regulatory requirements and/or compliance for the regs applicable to my clients. They are mostly regulated by the US FDA and there is a relevant Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 21 CFR 820 that is required. The requirements themselves are pretty short, but I have built my career around interpreting and implementing those requirements. In the last week I have used AI for the following use cases. Use case #1) I did an audit of a new client to ISO 13485:2016 and 21 CFR 820. In this case, I went onsite and went through all of their Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), forms, and templates. I did a facility tour. I also reviewed records that are associated with each SOP. I am checking to make sure their SOPs meet regulatory requirements, and that they are following their SOPs. I have done many audits and am proficient at it, but I have started to use AI for some of it. I use AI to "read" the SOPs for me. It is easy enough for, in this case ChatGPT, to compare the SOPs to ISO 13485 (which I upload, since it is proprietary), and 21 CFR 820 (publicly available). I then focus on reviewing the records. I also used AI to help with the report. I wrote my findings in plain english and used AI to translate it into appropriate "Report" verbiage by uploading example reports from the past. I also prepare a summary of the SOPs for the client using Notebook LLM where "I" detailed the shortcomings of each SOP so that they could easily make the revisions. Use case #2) I am working with a new client to implement a brand new Quality Management System (QMS) and I have several template QMSs available. However, I find that no one template is right for the client and that I often do some customizations before choosing the document package I will give to the client. In this case, the client already has an "off-the-shelf" QMS provided by their eQMS (electronic QMS) software company, and I need to review each of the provided SOPs to see what content, if any, to keep and merge with my template SOPs. In this case, I chose Notebook LLM because it allows me to upload a lot of content and it saves things as a knowledge base that I can return to over and over. I am not yet done with this project, as it is involved. But I have uploaded all of the eQMS provided SOPs and I the standard (ISO 13485 and 21 CFR 820, again). My desired output will be an excel table with the eQMS SOPs listed, my template SOPs and a status of each to indicate if it is "use-as-is", revise, merge or scrap. I am out of characters to respond. Do you want me to finish this thought in a new entry? I can also provide more use cases.

AI: That's incredibly detailed and helpful - thank you for painting such a clear picture of how you're integrating AI into your consulting work. I can see you're using it in some really sophisticated ways across different phases of your projects.

Tell me more about that decision-making process when you're working with AI on these SOPs. What made you decide to have AI "read" the SOPs for comparison rather than doing that part yourself?

User: Reading SOPs is very time consuming. There are always about 30 SOPs, each at least 3 pages, some closer to 15. That is at least 100 pages. The audit is essentially finding if each requirement is met, so if ISO 13485 says that the company shall determine competence of personnel performing tasks, the SOP should say that the company determines competence of personnel, etc. Before AI, I would use CTRL+F to find the word competence, which is still more efficient that reading all of the content, and then find where they address that. But AI is particularly well suited to match each requirement with where the SOP addresses it.

AI: That makes perfect sense - AI seems like a natural fit for that kind of systematic matching work. 

I'm curious about your comfort level with this approach. Are there parts of the SOP review process where you still prefer to handle things yourself, even though AI could potentially help? What makes those parts feel different to you?

User: Yes, I still do a fair amount myself. I don't have the AI just report "met" or "not met" but instead have it report back the actual sentence or clause # so that I can check, because there is a lot of nuance. I have to be aware that companies can address the requirements in a variety of ways. There are norms, but there is not requirement that they use the word competence. So, if I don't see competence, it could be called "on-the-job" or "functional" or "hands-on" training. Things like that. So I use AI as the first pass for all of the obvious stuff, but then I go through it and critically think about each shortcoming.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI for the first sweep but keeping that critical thinking layer yourself. It sounds like you've developed a good sense of where AI excels and where your expertise is irreplaceable.

When you're working with AI this way, how would you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more collaborating with it back and forth throughout the task, or do you tend to set it up with instructions and let it run independently before you review the results?

User: For this particular task, I set it up and let it run. I have created an Gem in Gemini and a GPT in ChatGPT that already has the standards, rules and regulations. But, I find that both limit my uploads, so I struggle with the volume of documents. That is why I have started to use Notebook LLM. Although, I don't like notebook LLMs output the best, it allows the most volume. It is important that all of the SOPs be reviewed together because an item can be addressed anywhere in the QMS, as long as it is addressed. I really struggle with the volume limitations. I then have it output one table and then I ask questions about topics that need follow-up and continue to interact with is as I go after it does the initial review.

AI: The volume limitations sound like a real practical constraint in your work. It's interesting how you've had to adapt your approach based on those technical limitations.

How have your colleagues or clients influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you encountered any particular reactions or expectations around AI use in your consulting practice?

User: I am pretty quiet about my use of AI unless the client has already mentioned that they use it. Sometimes, I don't tell them at all. For example, on a simple audit, I don't tell them that I did a first pass on the SOPs, because I charge a fixed-price. The AI is saving me time, and allows me to essentially earn more per hour, which the client does not need to know about. However, I sometimes tell a client that I did a thing on Notebook LLM (for example) and have even shared the canvas with them, for them to explore themselves, if we are all actively working on something that AI is particularly good at. I have heard from peers that their employers are very concerned about AI because of IP and confidentiality issues, and I am cautious to not upload anything proprietary such as product designs. But reviewing SOPs is pretty benign. I have not had any clients mention they are concerned about confidentiality or ask me outright if I use AI.

AI: It sounds like you're being quite strategic about when and how you discuss AI use with clients. That distinction you make between benefiting from efficiency gains versus actively collaborating with clients using AI is really interesting.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have many of being frustrated, unfortunately, as that is most of my interactions. I can only think of one example where I was really impressed and just couldn't believe how well it worked. I had a client that shared about 100 x-ray images with me. They pretty much all looked the same to the untrained eye - just a bunch of images of teeth from a dentist's routine x-rays. Each file name was unique, and indicated which test subject and the location of each image. I put them into ChatGPT in groups of 8 or so, and asked the AI to arrange them in a grid with the file name as the caption, and I asked it to format the name a certain way (ie take off the .png, or something like that). The end result was an array of images that I could plug directly into my report, which saved me hours of time. In this case, the images were not patient data, and were de-identified as only a subject ID. The study was for validation of the technology and not health records.

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like AI really excelled at that systematic formatting and organization task. The contrast you mention between that success and your "many" frustrating experiences is really telling.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is something I actively consider, and I wonder if I would have fewer frustrating experiences if I were to put more effort into learning how to use the API, or something more sophisticated than the web applications. Right now, AI isn't truly integrated into anything I do. I stop my work, open the web app, and then type in what I need, upload, etc. I would love to learn how to make agents or something that is more integrated. I tried Copilot, thinking it would be integrated with Microsoft Office, which I use all the time, but it let me down. I am a solo-preneur, and small business owner who is also doing all of my own consulting, so I am very cautious with my time. And I have not yet found a way to enhance my skills in a way that I am willing to commit to.

AI: That tension between wanting better integration and being cautious with your time investment as a solo practitioner really resonates. It sounds like you're in this in-between space where AI is helpful but not yet seamlessly integrated into your workflow.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I will continue to learn what it is good at, and what to avoid, and continue as is for the foreseeable future. If/when the AI companies develop more "integrate-able" solutions, for laypeople like me, I will adopt them. I look forward to that day and continue to try new offerings, and keep abreast so that I can use the latest features as they become available.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as that "first pass" tool while maintaining your critical thinking oversight, and how you're strategically navigating client relationships around AI use.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing that I can think of.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of integrating AI into specialized consulting work - from navigating volume limitations to maintaining professional discretion with clients - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the successes and frustrations. That kind of honest feedback is exactly what helps us understand how these tools are actually being used in the real world.

Have a great rest of your day!
