Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me (I have no questions)!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I am just finishing a PhD project where I am removing PFAS from water with activated carbon and detecting/quantifying the adsorbent performance with fluorine NMR.  Initial ideas came from reading the literature to find gaps in knowledge/where further work was needed, trial and error style methods with the fluorine NMR method, full characterisation of the activated carbons and then compiling all results in a thesis.

AI: That sounds like fascinating and important work, especially given the growing concerns around PFAS contamination. Thank you for walking me through that process.

Now, thinking about that project - from the literature review stage all the way through to compiling your thesis - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI in the data processing/analysis of the PFAS adsorption isotherm modelling.  AI was incredibly useful for quickly organising raw data and comparing the models to find which one provided the best fit, which then gave me information about the modes of adsorption.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI helped streamline what could have been a pretty time-intensive analysis process. 

Tell me more about how you decided to use AI for that isotherm modeling work versus sticking with your traditional approach. What was going through your mind when you made that choice?

User: I wanted to apply a new model, but it was so lengthy to do it all manually, so I just experimented with uploading the data to AI and asking it to fit the data to the Sips isotherm model, which it did very well.

AI: That's a great example of AI solving a practical time constraint. You mentioned it did the Sips isotherm fitting "very well" - I'm curious about that evaluation process.

When the AI produced those model fits and results, how did you go about verifying or validating what it had done to make sure you could trust those outputs for your thesis?

User: The Sips equation is fairly simple and it provided fits very similar to the Freundlich model, which I got the AI to fit and then I compared with my manually fitted Freundlich model.

AI: That's a smart validation approach - using your manual work as a benchmark to check the AI's reliability. It sounds like you're about one-third of the way through your PhD process from initial idea to thesis completion.

Thinking about the other parts of your research - the literature review, the trial-and-error NMR method development, the carbon characterization - what's kept you from trying AI in those areas?

User: I didn't use AI at this stage of the PhD a few years ago

AI: Ah, that makes perfect sense - the timing of when these tools became available relative to where you were in your research process.

Looking at it from where you are now, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - whether that's something from your past work or future research - what would that be and why?

User: Experimental design at the early stages of my PhD when I was less experienced - it would have saved a lot of mistakes

AI: That's such a valuable insight - the idea that AI could help with experimental design, especially when you're still developing that research intuition. It sounds like it could really accelerate that learning curve and prevent some of those costly trial-and-error cycles.

We're nearing the end of our conversation now. Those are all my main questions, and your perspectives on how AI served as a practical time-saver for complex modeling and how it might help with experimental design were particularly insightful.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a validation tool - comparing it against your manual work to build confidence in the results - and your point about how it could help with experimental design in those early research stages really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It's been great learning about your PFAS research and how you've thoughtfully integrated AI where it made practical sense. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks again for your time today!
