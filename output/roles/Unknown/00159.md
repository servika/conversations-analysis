Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds good. I am ready to begin when you are.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Well I work at an Arboretum seasonally as a Garden Technician so I mostly use AI for information about new plants we have coming in, or help answering specific questions from guests about different plants. So some days I will use AI several times throughout the day, and some days I won't use AI at work at all.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI as a botanical resource in real-time with guests sounds really practical. 

When you say you use it for information about new plants coming in, can you walk me through what that typically looks like? What kind of information are you usually seeking?

User: So let's say we have a new woody plant coming in, like a tree or large shrub. It's coming in as a 2-3 year plant but has an expected 30-40 year life cycle. I need to know were the best place to plant this tree or shrub where the conditions will be appropriate for the entire life cycle of the plant. I use AI to quickly find the information I need about the plant (Growth habit, mature size, soil conditions, etc.) and make a checklist for me so I can use it as a reference and guide as I choose the right spot to place the new plant. So I guess to summarize all that, I use it to help me make better choices for situations that have a long-term impact.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - thinking about the plant's entire lifecycle when making placement decisions. It sounds like AI helps you synthesize complex information quickly for these long-term decisions.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Hmm things like what to prune on a plant or what length to cut the grass. I prefer to make those decisions myself because I take pride in the fine detail hands-on work that I do so I want that to be all me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's clearly something meaningful about maintaining that direct, hands-on connection to the craft itself.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Almost always collaborative. Like how I take pride in the fine detail work, I don't want my work to be completely done by anyone or anything else. I always try to have a hand in any work that I do.

AI: That collaborative approach really comes through in how you describe your work - maintaining your involvement while leveraging AI as a tool.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Well, the arboretum I work for is an extension of a university. Some people at the university don't like when they see work that appears to have been done by AI. This is another reason that I try to always collaborate and not fully delegate tasks to AI. My direct colleagues haven't influenced my use of AI at work much. I have the mindset that whatever results in best outcome should at least be explored so if I think that using AI will result in a better outcome, I will try using AI for that task. Most of my colleagues have very similar mindsets. Honestly, any unwillingness to use AI has typically come from people higher up at the organization.

AI: That's an interesting dynamic - navigating different attitudes toward AI at different levels of the organization. It sounds like you and your direct colleagues are pragmatic about it, while there's more resistance from leadership.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time I was really satisfied with AI was when I was using it to create an information sheet for a  Magnolia. It was fantastic at finding and summarizing information that I could use, it did well following the format I needed and helping me get everything aligned, and did a good job proof reading the final version of the information sheet. One time, and this has been an issue I have noticed a few times when trying to generate things like images, was when I was trying to generate a template for a crossword puzzle for a camp activity for the kids. No matter what I said or how specific or general I made the prompt, the puzzle never looked right and followed all of the instructions I gave it.

AI: Those examples really highlight the contrast - AI excelling at information synthesis and formatting versus struggling with precise visual layouts. The crossword template situation sounds particularly frustrating when you kept adjusting your approach but couldn't get the result you needed.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have thought about this a little, but since my job is mostly physical I am not too concerned about it. The areas where I could see AI taking over in my field of Horticulture would definitely be the things I already use it for, information gathering and summarizing. I don't really consider this too much of an issue though because I think that the experience of enjoying nature is complimented by knowing all of the facts and information, but not the primary purpose for most. Having both a horticulturalist and AI to fully explain everything about a plant seems like a very full experience to me, one that compliments the other.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing AI as complementing rather than competing with the human experience of connecting with nature. It sounds like you view the combination as creating something richer than either alone.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I imagine that it will grow somewhat, with AI becoming more integrated in the information side of my job. I don't see AI being fully adapted by others in the horticulturalist field for quite a while, but I do see it eventually happening.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI can complement the human experience of nature rather than replace it - that collaborative mindset really comes through in everything you described.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope I can't think of anything. I hope this conversation has provided some insight into how AI could help with more nature based jobs.

AI: It absolutely has - your insights into using AI in horticulture and the seasonal, hands-on aspects of your work have been really valuable. The way you balance leveraging AI for information while maintaining that essential human connection to the craft is exactly the kind of nuanced approach we're hoping to understand better.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your perspective on human-AI collaboration in outdoor, nature-based work will be incredibly helpful for our research.
