Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Hello! That all sounds great, and I have no questions before we start.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I primarily use AI in three different areas at my day job. 

First, and I'm guessing a very common use, is to proofread emails before I send them. I don't send a ton of emails in my role, probably 3-7 per day depending on the day, but most of these emails are sent to external clients. I want to ensure I didn't make any grammatical errors or spelling mistakes, while also inviting the AI to "polish" my writing if it thinks part(s) of my message could be worded better or more clearly. 

Second, and similarly, I use AI to proofread and polish my reviews of certain products. I won't get too into detail about the type of products I review, but I'll say the reviews are typically 2-4 paragraphs long and talk about the positives and any negatives of the products, as well as generally informing readers on the product features and benefits. Like with my emails, I want to make sure these reviews sound professional and contain no errors. I usually ask the AI to polish only where necessary, as I still want the reviews to sound like me - I never have the AI write the reviews to begin with or rewrite entire reviews. This is also because I enjoy writing these reviews myself! 

And lastly, I use AI to help update product information. Product availability, prices, etc. fluctuate a lot, and I bring up the product information on two browser tabs - one containing the main supplier's page and the other containing my page about the product. I then input the pages into AI and ask for it to tell me the differences, so rather than scrolling through details upon details, anything that's changed is immediately flagged to me.

AI: That's a really clear picture of how you've integrated AI into your workflow. I'm particularly interested in what you mentioned about the product reviews - that you enjoy writing them yourself and want them to still sound like you.

Tell me more about that. What is it about writing those reviews that you enjoy, and how do you think about maintaining your own voice when you're asking AI to polish them?

User: I have always enjoyed writing - ever since I was in elementary school! My favorite subject in school was English. I then found myself at a job where one of my less frequent tasks is to write these product reviews. Because I'm passionate about writing and it's not something that comes up too often, I want to give it my best attempt and write each review first without enlisting AI. But I will say, AI comes in handy, often taking my reviews from good to great and catching anything that's confusing, misspelled, etc. I think using AI has even improved my writing - I've learned from it rather than just copied and pasted its suggestions without much thought. And to answer your other question, when asking AI to polish the reviews, I emphasize that it should keep the same tone.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you've found a way to use AI as more of a writing coach than a replacement. The idea that it's actually improving your own writing skills is really interesting.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Thanks! Yes, the initial writing of the product reviews is something AI could easily do. I would simply have to share the name of the product or provide a link, ask the AI to give me a 2-4 paragraph review with pros and cons in a certain tone/voice, and give it a few other pieces of guidance, and I'd have the review in seconds. However, like I mentioned before, I actually enjoy writing, and taking this first pass by myself also helps me learn about the product. Product knowledge is pretty important in my role!

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're getting multiple benefits from doing that initial writing yourself: the enjoyment, the learning about the product, and building that knowledge base that's important for your role.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'm more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task. In the example of writing product reviews, I'll go back and forth a few times with the AI to get an end result I feel is perfect. For instance, I might want certain adjectives changed, a different title for the review, or a shorter concluding paragraph.

AI: That back-and-forth collaborative approach sounds quite iterative. It seems like you've developed a pretty specific working relationship with AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: They use AI for similar tasks! One person on my team never sends an email without putting it into AI first. While I think that's kind of extreme (there's no need to do that for a "Confirming receipt, thanks!" email), it is an extra safeguard that she feels most comfortable with. And I believe the Finance Team uses AI a lot to help with Excel/Google Sheets formulas.

AI: Interesting - it sounds like there's a pretty open culture around AI use at your workplace, even if people have different comfort levels with it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes! I uploaded two PDFs and asked AI to find the differences between them. The pages should've been the same except for the intro paragraph and date, but I wanted to double check that this was true rather than reading the entire page (full of product reviews) myself. The AI ended up identifying words that differed in PDF 1, but those words didn't exist. I specifically remember it saying it found a double period in PDF 2, but in the spot it mentioned, there was only a single period. It gave a long list of false differences. This was frustrating and I ended up having to read both PDFs word for word. As expected, the only differences were the intro paragraph and date.

AI: That sounds really frustrating, especially since you were trying to save time and ended up having to do the work manually anyway. It's interesting that this happened with document comparison, which seems like it should be a straightforward task for AI.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes it is. I want to "stay sharp", so to speak, in my writing skills, so I continue writing on my own without using AI until I'm ready for proofreading and potential polishing. If I was in a major time crunch, I might have the AI write for me, but this would be a one-off situation and wouldn't cause my skills in this area to suffer.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - keeping your core skills sharp while still leveraging AI when it makes sense.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I will start using it more once I'm better aware of its capabilities. I definitely don't see myself using it less.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like you're still discovering what works best for you.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as more of a writing coach to improve your own skills, rather than just relying on it as a replacement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That is all I can think of for now, thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining and developing your own skills will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I hope you have a great rest of your day!
