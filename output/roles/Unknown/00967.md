Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No that is great, lets do the interview

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AT the moment I don't have it integrated with anything. It is a window that I have open that I refer to when I have questions about something strange, to redraft an email, or for help with spreadsheet formatting and formulas

AI: That's really helpful context - so it sounds like you're using it more as an on-demand resource rather than having it built into your existing tools. 

When you say you refer to it for "something strange" - can you tell me more about what those moments look like? What kinds of strange things come up that prompt you to turn to AI?

User: Something that i haven't heard of before, like a new work, phrase. The other day we used AI to research Dangerous goods requirements for transport. It is great to turn to for things that we don't do often and aren't familiar

AI: That's a great example - using it for those less familiar areas like dangerous goods transport requirements. It sounds like AI becomes particularly valuable when you're venturing into territory that's outside your regular expertise.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are alot of tasks that I handle myself currently that I know AI could do, and do it better and more effiently.  Not sure that is because I prefer to do them myself, but mainly because I don't know how to implement AI into those tasks, like calendars, or emails etc.  There is one task - planning our freight movements that AI could do, but I wouldn't fully automate until I am very confident in it becuase of the implications of something going wrong

AI: That's really insightful - you're drawing a distinction between tasks where you lack the technical know-how to integrate AI versus tasks where you have concerns about the stakes involved.

Tell me more about that freight movement planning. What would need to happen for you to feel confident enough to let AI handle more of that process? What are those implications you're thinking about if something goes wrong?

User: We currently use a spreadsheet and take the information from emails, phone calls and our transport system and plan the movements across all of our trucks based on weight, capacity, driver knowdlege and ability and planning the routes north and south.  Somethings are the same each day, some change. Would be great to autmate most of this planning aspect, but to keep a human oversight.  If freight is allocated to the wrong truck then the results are loss of confidence by the customer, claims for lost freight, costs to correct the issue etc. It is produce so the movements are time sensitive and need to be right frst time

AI: That paints a clear picture - you're managing a complex logistics operation where the consequences of mistakes cascade quickly, especially with time-sensitive produce. The idea of human oversight over automated planning makes a lot of sense in that context.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate. But that is a knowledge gap. When I learn to use it fully at work then I would be happy to leave it to complete a task. at the moment I drip feed tasks to it because thats all I know how to do

AI: That's a really honest perspective - recognizing that your current approach is shaped by what you know how to do rather than necessarily what you'd prefer. It sounds like there's a learning curve between where you are now with the "drip feeding" and where you'd like to be with more complete task delegation.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: our work culture is backwards with the main core group not open to change, but there are a few of us who implement it where we can. The issue is IT access is very restricted so we can be blocked by what we add to the computer

AI: So you're dealing with both cultural resistance from the core group and technical barriers through IT restrictions - that's a double challenge. It sounds like you and a few others are the early adopters trying to find ways to work within those constraints.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'll use the example that i had earlier - we were trying to ascertain if we needed to send documentation with a dangerous good because it was only a minor quantity. The AI was able to sift through the legislation a (hundreds of pages) and give us the correct answer with references so we could check. This meant we were able to send the product without delay. WIthout this knowledge there was a risk we would have help the freight back a day until we had the documents to be safe.  This was a satisfying result

AI: That's a perfect example of AI really shining - taking something that would have been time-consuming and potentially costly for you to research and delivering a quick, accurate answer with the references you needed to verify it. You avoided a day's delay on time-sensitive freight.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Interesting question - but i don't feel a need for that. Those skills would still be there one day in the future if I needed them - but If AI can do a tsk better and more efficiently than me and I can use it to improve my life, then why wouldn't I?  I don't need to keep that skill well honed if I don't use it. I can better use my time and energy elsewhere

AI: That's a refreshingly pragmatic view - focusing on where you can add the most value rather than holding onto tasks for their own sake. It sounds like you see AI as a way to free up your capacity for other things.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope that it will evolve hugely and take over email monitoring and truck planning. I see AI doing all of the routine bookings etc that take up so much of my time but yet I don't need to do. There is also anlysis that it could do better than me and reports it could write better than me but take up so much of my time. I just need to learn how to do it

AI: It sounds like you have a clear vision of where you want AI to take you - handling those routine, time-consuming tasks so you can focus on higher-value work. The learning piece seems to be the main bridge you need to cross to get there.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on not needing to maintain skills that AI can handle better - that's a really pragmatic way of thinking about this relationship.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no that's great, thank you. Answering these quetions has made me think about where I go from here implementing AI into my work.

AI: That's wonderful to hear - I'm glad the conversation helped crystallize some of your thinking about next steps. It sounds like you have a really clear sense of the potential and just need to work through the implementation challenges.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working within organizational constraints, the distinction between collaboration and delegation, and your practical approach to skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Best of luck with your AI implementation journey!
