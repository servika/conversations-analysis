Assistant: Hello! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good. Lets begin, I have no questions.

AI: Great, thank you. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm an independent game developer. As such I have to do a lot of research and problem solving for things like programming problems, game engine specific problems and workarounds, game design issues or techniques, for example: enemy path finding, melee combat design ect.
I will generally use AI tools to gather information and example approaches on certain topics and problems. For example: approaches for designing a pathfinding solution for enemies in a side-scrolling platformer game. Specific approaches are needed in this case so using an AI assistant can be helpful in narrowing the problem down to my specific use-case and working through a solution that fits my project.
Another smaller way I use AI assistants in my day to today workflow is for finding a solution to a smaller problem, like "how do I do this in that game engine". This is mainly to save time searching through forum posts or documentation.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like AI serves as both a research assistant and troubleshooting partner for you.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle the actual coding myself, unless it is something really minor, and use the AI assistant as a more high level research and problem dissection tool. Using the example of the pathfinding I mentioned above, I would use the AI assistant to narrow down a specific, high-level solution to my problem, taking into account the specifics of my project. Stuff like, is it tile-based, can enemies jump over gaps, are there limits to how far they can drop etc. 
From this, I would want the assistant to provide me the high level steps I need to take in order to write the solution. For example: "create an undirected graph, nodes represent "connection points" like a drop or jump, these nodes also contain location info and info on jump distance or drop height, edges represent which nodes are accessible from the each other, enemies have a reference to the navigation graph and the nodes currently accessible to them."
This example is very simplified, I would of course expect more detail and maybe some high level suggestions on how to code it, but this is how I use AI assistants for problems like this. I will then go and write the code myself and, if necessary, I will come back to continue the discussion if I notice something that was left out in the planning stage or needs to be changed now that implementation has begun.

AI: That's a fascinating approach - using AI as a strategic thinking partner rather than a code generator. It sounds like you value maintaining direct control over the implementation while leveraging AI's ability to break down complex problems.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to prefer a collaborative approach personally. Generally I will start with an overview of my problem/task and some specifics of my project setup, and ask for some suggestions and techniques I could employ to solve it.
Then I usually try and work through the problem in more and more detail in a kind of back-and-forth manner. For example, the model might suggest a certain approach/technique and I might respond with "What about this edge case, or this scenario, could this approach handle those?". This will continue until I m happy we've come up with a robust approach that factors in all the major specifics of my project/task.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth approach sounds really iterative and thoughtful. It's interesting how you use that dialogue to stress-test ideas before implementing them.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? As an independent developer, I imagine your situation might be quite different from someone in a traditional office setting.

User: Yes I imagine the way I use AI might be different from somebody in a more traditional workplace. I work mainly by myself, so I can't say that my use of AI has been influenced by any workplace culture. The main strength or benefit of it for me as a solo developer is being able to problem solve with a specificity that generally cannot be found by searching forums or documentation, as everybody's problems are a little different.
In an office setting you would have colleagues to brainstorm with or ask project specific questions. I don't have that so, to me, that's where the true value of AI assistants lies.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - AI essentially filling that collaborative brainstorming role that you'd normally have with colleagues. It sounds like it's particularly valuable for getting that project-specific guidance that generic resources can't provide.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't think of a specific scenario where I felt particularly satisfied or annoyed to be honest. My experiences have mostly been positive. For example, working through a solution to larger problems as mentioned above is quite satisfying because it saves a lot of time.
One particular instance I can think of from a while back was when I was struggling with a (seemingly simple) shader problem and spent hours researching online for solutions. Then I just typed the problem into an AI assistant and got a solution in about 30 seconds, which was pretty satisfying.

AI: That shader example really captures the efficiency gain - hours of searching condensed into 30 seconds! That kind of immediate problem-solving support sounds incredibly valuable for maintaining momentum in your work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: To be honest I don't think about it that much. For me AI assistants are tools that need to be used with an informed approach. I haven't come across a scenario yet where I feel my expertise is being replaced, or like I'm delegating too much. At the end of the day us developers still need to have an understanding of the software we build and I feel AI assistants are a means to speed up the process more than to replace the need for us to be experts in our fields.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective - viewing AI as an accelerator rather than a replacement. It sounds like you see your expertise as still essential for knowing how to guide the AI effectively and understand what it's suggesting.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Personally, I don't see it evolving too much from how I'm using it now. I think games are such a varied and multi-faceted field of software development that AI can't overtake completely. Ultimately it is also up to us as users how much we employ AI in our workflow, and for me it will probably stay the way it is now.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI serving as that collaborative brainstorming partner that fills the gap of not having colleagues - that's a unique angle I hadn't considered before.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks, I have nothing to add. Thanks for the interview.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a strategic thinking partner and the unique value it provides for independent developers will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today. Have a great rest of your day!
