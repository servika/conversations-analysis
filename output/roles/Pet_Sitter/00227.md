Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope, no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostly use it for client communication, especially rephrasing sensitive emails into a professional tone

AI: That's interesting - using AI to help with the tone and professionalism of client communications. 

Tell me more about that. What does that process typically look like for you when you're working on one of those emails?

User: I'm a pet-sitter, so it's often an issue with someone's animal I'm writing about. I'll put the issue into AI (usually chatgpt) and ask it to frame it more professionally. For example, I'll say, "help me write an email to a client telling them their cat is being aggressive"

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those conversations about pet behavior can definitely be delicate to navigate with clients.

When you're drafting these emails, do you usually write out your initial thoughts first and then ask the AI to help rephrase them, or do you start by describing the situation to the AI and let it create the email from scratch?

User: I write out my thoughts and the core content of what I want to communicate to the client first, and then just bring in the AI to help me phrase it professionally

AI: So you're maintaining control over the core message and content, but leveraging AI specifically for that professional polish. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your pet-sitting work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes, I still write the bulk of my client communications myself. It feels different because I want my clients to have a better sense of my personality and what I love about their pets - it feels more personal and authentic to write those myself, and I believe that leads to more trust from my clients

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - using AI for the professional framing but keeping the personal, relationship-building communication in your own voice.

When you do use AI for rephrasing those sensitive emails, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you going back and forth with it to refine the message, or do you tend to give it your draft and use whatever it generates?

User: I always read the draft it provides carefully. Sometimes, with more simple issues I can use what it generates on the first try with minimal edits, but for more complicated emails or if the tone isn't quite right, I go back and forth

AI: So it sounds like there's a real collaborative process happening, especially with those trickier situations where you need to get the tone just right.

How have your colleagues or other pet-sitters you know influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or has your approach developed pretty independently?

User: independently, I have my own business without colleagues/staff, and other pet sitters don't discuss AI usage much in the forums I participate in

AI: That makes sense - you've been figuring this out on your own as a solo business owner.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I recently had a client whose cat attacked me on the second visit out of what should have been a 3 week sit. I used AI to help me refine the message I sent letting her know I would be unable to continue services both for my own safety and that of the cat, and to help her understand what her options were with the app that linked us to ensure her cats still received care. AI was very helpful in helping me hit a professional tone with that email at a time that I was pretty upset

AI: That sounds like a really challenging situation - being attacked and having to end a long booking while you were upset. It's interesting that AI was able to help you maintain that professional tone when your emotions were running high.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not with pet-sitting. AI can do a lot, but for an in-person service like this, I don't see a threat to my job security.. .

AI: That's a really good point - the hands-on, in-person nature of pet-sitting does seem pretty secure from AI replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or do you think you'll stick with the current approach?

User: I think that depends on how exactly AI evolves. I could certainly see an increase in incorporating it into my booking process and initial contact emails, and potentially for marketing, but at this point I don't necessarily trust it enough to hit the right tone and prefer traditional email sequences I've written myself.

AI: That's really insightful - you're open to expanding its use but maintaining control over areas where trust and relationship-building are crucial.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you maintain authenticity in client relationships while still leveraging AI for those sensitive professional communications.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between AI assistance and personal authenticity in client relationships will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
