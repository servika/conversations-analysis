Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, that all sounds fine. let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI is a tool that saves me a lot of time. As a writer, I use AI to bounce ideas off, help me find different ways of constructing a sentence or paragraph and brainstorm ideas. But, as a Inde author, I use it to help me with designing book covers and generating image for online my online content to promote my books.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI across both the creative writing process and the business side of being an independent author. 

When you say you bounce ideas off AI, can you walk me through what that typically looks like? How does that conversation usually unfold?

User: So, I have an idea of where I want my story to go, for example, in this chapter the main character, Bill, an apprentice magician goes into a tavern to meet his friends, this is set in a medieval type village located in a magical realm where the locals are a mixture of human, wizards, witches, dwarves, goblins etc. Please can you give me some things that I might find in that tavern to enhance my description.

AI: So you're giving AI that kind of detailed context and asking for specific environmental details to enrich your world-building. That sounds like a pretty collaborative approach.

Tell me more about how you decide what to ask AI for versus what you want to create entirely on your own. What makes you think "I'll handle this part myself" versus "let me get AI's input on this"?

User: Before using AI I would spend a lot of time researching things for the book. In the example above, I would try and find historic descriptions of a medieval tavern and then merge that with things I would make up to make it fit into a magical realm. AI takes away some of the research that I used to do. It can do it infinitely quicker than I can.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're essentially using AI to accelerate the research phase that you were already doing. 

I'm curious about the creative aspects though. Are there parts of your writing process where you specifically don't want AI involved, even if it could potentially help? What feels important for you to maintain control over?

User: I want AI to assist in the time consuming tasks, but I want the story to be mine. Once I start writing the story takes on a life of its own, things come out of my head and on to the page that I never planned or expected - that is my voice, my creativity at work and it is important to me that that is not taken away by letting AI take over the creative process. Sure, sometimes I will get stuck and ask the AI how I can transition from one scene to the next, but that is the exception rather than the rule.

AI: That distinction between your creative voice and the research assistance is really clear. It sounds like you've found a way to use AI that preserves what feels most essential to you as a writer.

When you do use AI for those transitions or when you get stuck, how do you typically interact with it in those moments? Do you work back and forth with AI on the problem, or do you ask for suggestions and then take it from there on your own?

User: In these situation, I would give an outline of the scene and then explain what the difficulty is, for example, Jack and Katie are having a discussion about why Bill is being so sullen and withdrawn, they do not know the real reason, so they have been throwing ideas at each other about what might be the problem. I need to bring this conversation to a close and Jack will leave to go back to work, but the conversation seems to have run dry, they haven't reached a conclusion, how can I conclude the conversation in a friendly  manner?

AI: So you're giving AI the specific narrative problem you're trying to solve. Once AI gives you suggestions for how to handle that transition, what do you typically do with those ideas? Do you take them directly, or do you use them as a starting point to develop your own approach?

User: Sometimes I will take the suggestions as it is. Sometimes the suggestion will inspire me to do something along the same lines and sometimes I will go back to the AI and give more details of ask for a different approach. it depends on what the response is.

AI: That sounds like a pretty fluid process where you're adapting based on what feels right for each situation.

I'm curious about your workplace culture as an independent author - how have other writers or people in the publishing community influenced how you think about using AI? Have you encountered different attitudes toward AI use among your peers?

User: I have detected a concern over the ability of AI to create works of fiction. Some see it as a threat, that they will not be needed any more, especially in the ghost writer industry. Someone will go to a ghost writer with the premise for a story or a biography and then the ghost writer turns that into a cohesive narrative. Their worry is that in the not too distant future it will be easier and quicker to give the premise to an AI instead.

AI: That's a real concern you're hearing from others. How do you think about that potential future yourself? Do you see AI as something that might change the demand for human writers, or do you view it differently based on how you're using it?

User: I would like to think of AI as a collaborator rather than a threat. I think that AI's base their creativity on a vast knowledge of what has already been created by humans and manipulate that into something different, I don't thing, certainly at this stage, that they are capable of creating something completely new and original.

AI: That perspective on AI as building from existing human creativity is thoughtful. You mentioned earlier how the story "takes on a life of its own" when you write - that sounds like something quite different from recombining existing elements.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When an AI generates the exact image that I wanted is the most satisfying thing. I carefully describe the image I want and it might take two or three attempts, but finally I get the perfect image, sometimes even surpassing my expectations. That really makes me satisfied and excited about using AI.

AI: That excitement when AI exceeds your expectations sounds really rewarding! 

On the flip side, have you had any particularly frustrating experiences with AI in your work? Times when it just wasn't getting what you needed or created more work instead of saving time?

User: Yes, Tha

AI: It looks like your message got cut off there. You were starting to tell me about a frustrating experience - could you continue with that thought?

User: Yes, that has happened too. Sometimes I have to be careful how I word things because it trips the AI safety systems and I can't get back on track. I know that saying I am a writer does not change the setting, but it can be frustrating that it mistakes my intentions.

AI: That sounds really frustrating when you're working on legitimate creative content but the safety systems are interpreting your requests differently than you intended. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you use these tools?

User: I don't worry about maintaining skills such as researching, I still do a lot of research myself when I am coming up with the stories. I use the AI when I am in the middle of a writing session and breaking off to search information would disrupt the flow. However, as far as image creation is concerned, I was never much good at that so I am very grateful for the help.

AI: That makes sense - using AI to maintain your creative flow rather than replace skills you value. It sounds like for images, AI is actually enabling you to do something you couldn't do as well before.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think the way you use it will change as the technology develops?

User: I think that it is inevitable that the way I use AI will change as it develops. I would like to use it to help me create video content for social media. I think this is possible now, but it is quite expensive, however, as with most things, as it develops, the cost will most likely come down.

AI: That expansion into video content sounds like a natural progression from the book covers and promotional images you're already creating.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborator while preserving your creative voice, and how you've found ways to maintain your writing flow without compromising what feels essential to your process.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think you have covered everything. I enjoy using AI and see it as an incredibly useful collaborative assistant rather than a threat, and I look forward to seeing it develop.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between collaboration and maintaining creative ownership, and how you've integrated AI into different aspects of being an independent author, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Thank you.

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day, and best of luck with your writing projects.
