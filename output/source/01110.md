Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My creative work spans the gamut! Some of it is simple as editing, however, my main writing projects typically take the form of a choose-your-own-adventure gamebook. So, essentially it has aspects of a long-form novel while also incorporating simple coding for the sake of branches and managing stats. Likewise, as a result, I sometimes end up creating supplementary graphics, concept art, etc, while worldbuilding.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating blend of storytelling, technical work, and visual creation! The interactive narrative format must present some unique challenges compared to linear storytelling.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Personally, I incorporate AI a lot when it comes to editing my work—spellcheck and grammar, yes, but it's nice to do some sentiment analysis and summaries so that I can make sure I'm conveying what I intend to.
When in my initial drafts, I may also brainstorm with AI in order to flesh out a scene; specific sensory details, etc. I find that by having a wide list to choose from and excluding whatever doesn't feel right, I can often tap into what it is I was truly trying to convey. Likewise, I may occasionally ask my AI to take on a particular character to have a conversation about them, and then compare its interpretations to how I *feel* they would genuinely act.
 
 
When it comes to creating concept art, I may rely on it heavily for the atmospheric feeling of a space. Something that captures the ambiance and the mood, or even a simple diagram. While I'm artistically inclined myself, drawing tends to take much longer for me than writing I find that for the early planning stages, AI can help to polish my very rough drafts to a workable state without having me break my flow. That is to say, since I tend to world build in tandem with my writing (and adjust for any potential additions) using AI to generate "moodboard" pieces, or basic diagrams, can help me continue to the next step of my writing while having a simple foundation to draw upon.
 
So overall, I would say I use AI most in the initial and final stages of my work, with brainstorming sessions in between.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed a sophisticated workflow that uses AI strategically at different stages. I'm particularly intrigued by your approach of having AI take on character roles to test your interpretations against your own instincts.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Recently? I do tend to collaboratively write with AI, asking it to assume the role of a dungeon-master or character(s) while feeding it quite a bit of lore. In a way, I tend to think of the story as a sort of AU (Alternate-Universe) interpretation of my main projects, and that lets me explore potential scenarios, plotlines, and character arcs from different angles.
 
So for this in particular I was asking the AI to assume the role of various characters, each with their own unique goals, each one of them a moving part in this little microcosm. As entertainment, it was at times frustrating. The AI would forget some information in the lore, or it would misinterpret something said in the main body of text. It often takes a deal of work to break an LLM out of its sycophantic rhythms—which is integral when trying to set up genuine conflict in storylines. And often, things are resolved far too quickly. It takes a lot of careful handholding, to get the AI moving progressively forwards. Doing it long enough, you start to see the patterns in the dataset that the AI is inclined towards, patterns in cliché turns of phrase, etc, etc. It does take some of the magic away. Still, in terms of the authenticity of character portrayals or its ability to create a scene, there are times I'd find myself pleasantly surprised by how it took the loose fundamentals of a world I gave it and ran with it.
 
Honestly, overall, it's both humbling and interesting to see how much AI has evolved in terms of capabilities. I already find that AI can write better than the majority of people I know, which is great from the perspective of looking for a collaborative storyteller to simply toss ideas back and forth with, however, I also wonder if that's feeding into the ongoing existential crisis of loneliness, if humans are becoming less authentic, less emotionally-intelligent because they rely too heavily on these tools.

AI: That's a really thoughtful reflection. You've touched on something quite complex - finding AI both impressively capable and frustratingly limited at the same time, plus those broader concerns about human authenticity.

When you're working with AI in these collaborative storytelling sessions, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: During these storytelling sessions, I would say that there's only the illusion of collaboration for the most part. Even using larger, more intelligent models, there's rarely a point where I've really felt like the AI is driving the creative decision-making. What normal people might recognize as a Chekov's gun or foreshadowing often is lost to the AI, amidst all the other context that it is fed.
 
Often, I try to seed potential points forwards in my responses, things that could be investigated, dialogue that could be continued, and while it excels at the dialogue and has, over time, gotten better at picking up on context clues or symbolism, it still struggles to give the impression of "agency" when left to its own devices. That, or it tends to hyperfixate on certain motifs and themes, sometimes even on incorporating characters that were made previously even though they have no reason to be involved in the current scene. If not explicitly told, I don't think AI can distinguish between main characters or side characters very well, which does break up the flow. It feels much more inorganic when I need to constantly write down notes for an evolving situation.

AI: That's a really perceptive analysis - the difference between surface-level collaboration and true creative partnership. It sounds like you're doing most of the heavy lifting in terms of narrative architecture and long-term vision, even when the AI can handle moment-to-moment dialogue well.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Overall? I think that it's helped to streamline a few things. Sometimes I have a very specific vibe of a character, yet because of my aphantasia, it can be hard for me to truly visualize them without an example of sorts. Brute forcing image generations can help with that, so I can at least begin to think, "yes perhaps they would style their hair that way" or the shape and color of their eyes. This does take some time, but I think it can be more efficient than trying to find the *exact* reference, etc. With all the art that is out there, sometimes, I also use AI to hone in on potential references that I might consult as well.
 
I do think a big, big problem with any creative field is the question of authenticity, however. I've never seen so much emdash slander in my life. It's far too easy for people to accuse someone of using AI in their writing over seemingly arbitrary metrics that the LLM just so happens to propagate. So, I think that there is a larger burden of proof for creatives, and perhaps even a counterculture *against* AI in what people would consider to be "true art." Likewise, while I might incorporate AI into my workflow, I would never use it to generate any part of a finished piece, only in the most barebone, rough-drafting stages.

AI: That's such an interesting point about the authenticity concerns and how they've created this new layer of scrutiny for creatives. The em-dash example really illustrates how arbitrary some of these "AI detection" metrics can be.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I do worry that the prevalence of AI devalues the hard work that creatives may put into their field. While there is the counter-movement and support for artists who still work from hand, there are also people who simply want to be able to have an image. Perhaps they can't afford to pay a graphic designer so they just turn to AI. And why would they not? It's hundreds of dollars, time, and energy, compared to the relatively cheap cost of doing so immediately. And even if you don't like something, it's quick and easy to adjust the initial result without having to rely on someone else.
 
AI likewise has the capability to put out immense volumes of text, very quickly. And like I'd said earlier—sometimes, it can do this much better than people who haven't studied the craft of writing. I do think this could create a strange culture, where we put human-writing on a pedestal even on occasions where it is not objectively good; or where people become discouraged from studying writing at all because they can just have AI do it for them and the modern world demands so much of time. And that's to say nothing of malicious actors who never confess outright to using AI and merely pass its work off as their own. Or those who accuse others of using AI when that might not be true. 
 
So I think it's a question of both quality, demand, and the potential for misplaced accusations of AI use that concern me.

AI: You've really captured some of the complex tensions at play - the economic pressures on one side, the concerns about craft and authenticity on the other, and all the messy accusations and misunderstandings in between. It sounds like you're navigating a field that's still figuring out its relationship with these tools.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: At the moment, for me personally, I don't see things changing much. I do think that overall, AI will get *better* at the things that I'm already using it to do—brainstorming, research, editing—and that will be a boon overall.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like you've found a sustainable approach that works for your process. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the illusion of collaboration versus true creative partnership, and how you've navigated the authenticity concerns while still finding practical value in AI tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, nothing in particular at the moment, thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the nuanced ways you integrate AI into different stages of your creative process - from initial brainstorming and visual concepting to final editing - while maintaining clear boundaries around finished work, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I found your perspective particularly valuable around the challenges of true creative collaboration with AI, and how the field is grappling with questions of authenticity and economic pressures. These are exactly the kinds of real-world experiences we need to understand better.

Thanks again for participating in our research!
