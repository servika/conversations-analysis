Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

I'd love to start by hearing about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: One recent project was to measure how isotopes affect the oscillation frequency of an oscillating chemical reaction, specifically the Briggs-Rauscher reaction.

AI: That sounds fascinating! Tell me more about how that project unfolded - what were the key steps you went through from when you first had that idea to actually getting your results?

User: A student had asked me about this reaction and I suggested checking the literature to see what work had been done on isotopic versions of the reaction. I asked her to do a detailed literature review to see had been done previously.

AI: That's a great starting point. What happened after the literature review - what were the next steps in actually carrying out the research?

User: I did a quick google search myself and didn't come up with much. She did a more in depth search with Deep Research and found an amazing set of papers, but still nothing on isotopic studeis of this reaction.

AI: That's really interesting - so you both did literature searches, but using different approaches. Tell me more about that difference between your quick Google search and her using Deep Research - what made you each choose those different methods?

User: We're all familiar with google searches. They're good starting points and sometimes you get lucky and find exactly what you need, but often times it's just a list of rabbit holes. AI search capabilities are much more directed and directable. There's no comparison in terms of quality of the results - AI is vastly superior.

AI: That's a really compelling comparison. When you say AI search is "more directed and directable," can you give me a specific example of what that looked like for your student with the isotope research?

User: In our case we were looking for multiple parameters simultaneously to both improve the length and depth of the oscillations and to determine how isotope substitutions would alter the reaction. For example, we would specify that Deep Search look for all papers related to a certain chemical indicator that we were using to make the oscillations more visually compelling. This produced a small subset number of very useful papers, in contrast to the vast number of papers on the topic. And it's not just the list of papers that was useful, it's the commentary and summary of each that can really be a time saver.

AI: That level of specificity and the commentary sounds incredibly valuable. Once you had those targeted results and summaries from Deep Research, what was the next phase of your project - how did you move from the literature findings to actually designing and conducting your experiments?

User: Once the chemical indicator issues were sorted out, and because there were so few papers on isotope substitution for this reaction, we just dove into the isotope reaction in the lab. They worked remarkably well.

AI: That's great that the experiments worked well! We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. 

As you moved through the experimental phase and then analyzing your results, did you find yourself using AI tools again, or was that primarily in the initial literature review stage?

User: For this project, the primary use of AI was in the initial phases. We haven't written up these result yet, but it is my expectation that the student will use AI to help with writing the paper. I haven't used AI for this purpose yet, but I would like this student to do so.

AI: That's really interesting - so you see potential for AI in the writing phase even though you haven't used it there yourself yet. What makes you think it would be valuable for your student to try AI for writing up the results, and what's kept you from experimenting with it for that purpose so far?

User: For the student, I think she will benefit from the speed and grammatical/syntactical correctness that AI offers. It can get students closer to a finished product more quickly, which helps to maintain their enthusiasm for the project. In my case, I write fairly mathematical papers, with a lot of quantitative details drawn from multiple fields. I've been a bit reluctant to trust AI with some of these details. I feel like I would send a lot of time correcting small errors. But, worry not - I do plan to use AI for writing more, both proposals and papers.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - speed and engagement for your student versus your concern about accuracy with complex mathematical details. When you do decide to try AI for your more technical writing, how do you think you'll approach verifying or validating what it produces, especially with those quantitative details from multiple fields?

User: I'll approach validation by asking an AI to produce a document of a given content and length, and then I will go through all of it. Fact checking is an essential part of science. This will be fact checking but in a different order than I usually do it.

AI: That's a clever way to think about it - essentially shifting the fact-checking process. Looking ahead, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research work that it currently doesn't handle well or at all, what would that be and why?

User: A couple of things. First, the writing style should match my own writing style. Some AI's give an overly bubbly response to a technical question or technical topic. The bot should be capable of reading a few of the authors papers to get a sense of the user's writing style, and incorporate some of that style in their responses. This is most relevant for documents, papers and proposals. Second, the AI should not always be so confident in its errors. Any working scientist keeps a list in their mind of what can go wrong while they're working on something. Perhaps the AI could offer something similar - a way for the use to see where the AI has some uncertainty its response or in the product it has been asked to make.

AI: Those are both really insightful points - matching writing style and being transparent about uncertainty. The idea of an AI showing you where it's less confident, like a scientist's mental list of potential issues, is particularly compelling.

We're wrapping up now. Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI search vastly outperforms traditional methods and your thoughtful approach to validation were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: A capability to read and interpret figures from papers  - but I'm sure progress is being made on this. And also to be able to produce figures from he results of a calculation. I'm sure that too is being worked on.

AI: Those are excellent points - visual interpretation and generation capabilities would really complete the research workflow integration. The ability to analyze figures from literature and then create publication-ready figures from your own data would be incredibly valuable.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI's superiority in targeted literature search and your approach to shifting fact-checking rather than avoiding AI altogether really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The way you're thinking about maintaining scientific rigor while embracing AI's efficiency is particularly valuable for us to hear.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!

User: Thank you

AI: You're very welcome! I really enjoyed our conversation and learned a lot from your perspective. Have a great rest of your day!
