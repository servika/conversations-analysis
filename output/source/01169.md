Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a multi-genre author under the speculative fiction umbrella, so I write everything from post-apocalyptic thrillers to sci-fi love stories. I started out in traditional publishing writing romance, but later switched to self-publishing, which means I'm responsible for all stages of creating a book, including the editing, proofreading, cover design, marketing materials, etc. A typical project starts out with 6 months to over a year of the actual writing, followed by the editing process, then making the book cover. I also usually make a book trailer for social media, along with other marketing materials. I document my writing process on social media (I use X) and sometimes post images representing various scenes I'm currently working on.

AI: That's fascinating - you really handle the entire creative pipeline from initial concept to marketing. With all those different stages you mentioned, I'm curious about where AI comes into play for you.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I do the actual writing myself, but I often use AI for the research, and it's very helpful! As an example, for my current book, I have a character who had a medical issue, and I used AI to tell me exactly what doctors would likely do in her situation upon her arrival to the emergency room. What procedures and tests would happen and in what order, what they would likely say to her, when she would get answers, how long she would have to be hooked up to breathing machines or recovering after surgery, etc. Another thing AI has been useful for is creating art and video for book covers, trailers, and other promotional materials. I always made my own book covers using stock art in the past, so rather than using AI to generate a completed cover, I use it to make various elements that I edit together creatively. Same with the book trailers. I get a bunch of short clips and make them into a film. More recently, since it's improved at making text, I've also been using it to design unique text for my titles. During the writing process, I sometimes describe the scene I'm working on, get an image, and post it to my X account with an update on the writing process and the current scene. This is an interesting way to share what I'm creating.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using AI as both a research assistant and a creative collaborator for visual elements. It sounds like you've found some very specific applications that complement your existing skills.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: For my most recently released post-apocalyptic series, I used AI to create a book trailer. I used Midjourney to make the images and Runway to animate them. I also used video clips made in Pika video generator. At the time, I thought it was really cool, but this was a couple years ago, and the video tools have improved so much since then that it looks pretty bad now. I've always really enjoyed editing film, so these projects are great fun for me.

AI: It sounds like you really enjoyed that creative process of assembling all those AI-generated elements into your trailer. You mentioned the technology has improved dramatically since then - that must give you a unique perspective on how quickly things are evolving.

When you're working with AI on these projects, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm in charge of driving all creative decisions. I'm really specific with my prompts, and it's sometimes taken hundreds of tries before I've gotten the AI to give me an image that matches my exact vision. The models have improved over time and made this a bit easier, but it still takes some work to get what I want. I feel like the AI is my worker or assistant more than it's a 50/50 collaboration in most cases. However, there are times where I do play around with an image generator, giving it more freedom to go wild. It's interesting to see the stuff it comes up with and sometimes a certain image will give me ideas for a story or something like that.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - mostly directing it like an assistant, but also sometimes letting it surprise you and spark new ideas. It sounds like you've developed quite a technique for getting specific results through your prompting.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Definitely book covers and book trailers. For my first self-published book, I spent over a month searching the web trying to find public domain or cheap stock images and videos I could use. It was extremely challenging and time consuming. Same with book covers. I never had the money to hire a professional artist, so I'd be at the mercy of whatever existed on stock image websites, and it's very hard to find appropriate images for my type of writing on those. Being able to generate high-quality images and videos that are personalized for my stories has been amazing.

AI: That's such a concrete example of how AI has solved a real workflow problem for you - going from a month of searching to being able to generate exactly what you need. That must feel incredibly liberating creatively.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm not really concerned. I don't make much money doing this to begin with, and there were already millions of other books on Amazon that I'm competing with, so knowing AI will be able to write books soon doesn't really bother me. I know a lot of authors are very worried about this, but I ultimately create because it's fun, not to be famous or make money. I also don't fully buy the theories that "everyone will just prompt and make their own books one day using AI" because 1) not everyone is creative enough to even think up a subject 2) people are lazy, and 3) I think a lot of people will still prefer to read human writing. Overall, the creative potential being made possible by AI far outweighs any negatives in my opinion.

AI: That's a really thoughtful and balanced perspective. Your point about creating for the joy of it rather than primarily for commercial success seems to give you a different lens than some other authors might have.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: It's exciting to think about! As I said earlier, I really enjoy editing films, although I'm not really into the actual filming part, so AI video is perfect for me. I could see myself potentially getting into making movies or shows with it one day. Possibly even making movies out of some of my books. I'll continue to use it for my writing as well.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative control while also being open to AI's surprising contributions, and your refreshingly pragmatic view about AI's impact on the industry.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's about it. Thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative tool while maintaining authorial control, and your practical approach to the technological changes in publishing, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciated hearing about your journey from traditional to self-publishing and how AI has solved some very real workflow challenges for you. Best of luck with your current writing project and future film endeavors!
