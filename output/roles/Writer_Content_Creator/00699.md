Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually use AI to help me prepare lecture materials, review my writing, and answer any questions I'm stuck on when it comes to a research question

AI: That's helpful context - it sounds like you're in academia. 

Tell me more about how you use AI when preparing lecture materials. What does that process typically look like for you?

User: Mostly I let the AI help inspire my content and flow, and then I create the presentation myself. I do this to ensure I'm not missing anything when I decide what to talk about and to get a second opinion on how to structure things

AI: That's interesting - you're using AI more as a brainstorming partner for the structure and content ideas rather than having it create the materials directly. 

When you say you want to make sure you're not missing anything, can you walk me through what that looks like? How do you typically interact with the AI during that process?

User: Likely I would go to the model when brainstorming the lecture content and ask it a few questions about my content. I might clarify my understanding of something I'm going to cover, ask for different sources or ask for a sample presentation in writing about my topic. Then I take what it sends me and adapt it per my vision

AI: So you're getting that clarification and gathering different perspectives before shaping it into your own approach. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I really value the "humanness" of writing and I avoid using AI to fully generate anything I write or produce. I feel that LLM-generated writing has a distinctive style that can strip the personality from an individual's writing. Instead, I turn to AI once I've already written to double check I haven't made any errors, help me reduce word count, or give me alternative phrasing ideas.

AI: That's a thoughtful distinction you're making about preserving your own voice in your writing. 

Can you describe what you mean when you say LLM-generated writing has a "distinctive style"? What do you notice about it that feels different from human writing?

User: I think it's designed to follow a basic paragraph and response structure, which is fully correct and is how most high school students are taught to write. But in practice, most writers deviate from the typical intro-claim-supporting detail-conclusion format and that is what makes their work more unique. Sometimes the LLM writes better than me even, but often it starts to sound repetitive in its voice throughout a longer text

AI: That's a really insightful observation about how the formal structure can become repetitive and lose individual variation.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate with it. I usually use it to get ideas, clarification, or feedback regarding my work. Occasionally I might ask it to generate a figure or a table but not much else

AI: So it sounds like you're working alongside the AI rather than handing off entire pieces of work to it.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I see different opinions on AI throughout my workplace. Some embrace it fully, others are more wary. I tend to ride the middle line. I think I would have been even more wary if I didn't start working with it sooner because of my colleagues and my jobs, but because i've had contact with it I'm less reserved than before

AI: That middle-ground approach seems to have developed through your actual experience with it. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfied: I was tasked with writing a 2,500 word proposal for a research project and I spent two weeks learning about the topic and writing the proposal, only to find out 3 days before that it needed to be 2,500 characters. I sent it to a chatbot and had it reduced, which saved me lots of time and headache.
Frustrated: The other day I asked it to make a figure for me for a mediation model. At first, it stated it had made the figure but didn't include an image or a file. Then, it included a blank file twice. Once it sent me an image, it was incredibly inconsistent in how it labelled the figure (didn't follow APA format, mixed fonts and shapes, etc). I ended up doing it myself

AI: Those are really vivid examples that highlight both the strengths and limitations. The proposal situation sounds like it was perfect for that kind of editing task, while the figure creation clearly fell short of your professional standards.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think about it too deeply as I don't think my field is at risk of being taken over by AI, if that's what you mean. In general I've diversified my skills as a worker but not because of AI. I don't think my skills are at risk of being "lost" by my AI use as I only collaborate with it.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like you feel confident about your field's resilience and your collaborative approach keeps you actively engaged in the work itself.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm not too sure. I think I enjoy where I'm at with the models, but probably I will see AI integrated into the data collection and analysis process in the future more than it is now.

AI: That's an interesting prediction about data collection and analysis becoming more AI-integrated.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on preserving the "humanness" in writing while still finding valuable collaborative uses for AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that middle ground between embracing and being cautious with AI, along with your specific examples of when it works well versus when it falls short, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
