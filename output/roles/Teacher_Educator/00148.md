Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good, lets get started

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As a math tutor and center director of a learning center, I do not use AI tools much. However, some of the software we use to manage students and sales opportunities uses AI. AI helps us keep track of leads by sending automated reminders when new leads come in. Also, the AI in the software we use helps us identify when students are not completing enough work during their sessions at our learning center. Personally, when I am tutoring a student, i will sometimes use AI to refresh some math topics that I have not taught in a while. Additionally, I use AI to generate math problems sometimes to help students prepare for tests or quizzes.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI touches your work in some more behind-the-scenes ways through your management software, and then you also use it directly for tutoring preparation.

When you use AI to refresh math topics you haven't taught in a while, can you walk me through what that process looks like for you?

User: Sure. I was working with a student last week who is taking AP calculus BC and there was a question about indefinite integrals that I was a bit unpracticed on. To be sure that I was teaching the topic correctly, and my understanding was accurate, I asked the AI model to state some of the theorems related to that topic so that I could be sure I was teaching it in the correct way.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it as a way to double-check your understanding before teaching. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: The few times that I had used AI to generate additional math problems, I found that they were not as good as problems I could make up by myself. For example, yesterday I was working with a pre-calculus student on reference angles and arc lengths. I asked the model to generate extra practice on arc lengths. I found that it took longer for me to ask the AI model to generate those problems than it would have if I had done it myself on paper. Additionally, the model required alot of follow up to get exactly what I wanted. The answers were in not in terms of pi and I had to ask for it to generate an answer key as well.

AI: That's a really concrete example - it sounds like the back-and-forth with the AI actually made the process less efficient than just creating the problems yourself. 

When you do use AI for work tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Usually I will assign the AI independent tasks. Usually as problems come up, I will ask the model and then resume working with the student. Generally, I can get what I want in two or fewer turns.

AI: So it sounds like you use it more as a quick consultation tool - you pause, ask it something specific, and then get back to working with your student.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I would say that it hasnt.

AI: Tell me more about that. Are your colleagues using AI tools at all, or is it something that just doesn't come up much in conversations at your learning center?

User: As the center director, I use AI tools to manage students and parent interactions. However, I do not use AI tools in conjunction with my coworkers. Alot of the work I do is independent and I do not do much collaboration with my coworkers that utilizes AI.

AI: I see - so your AI use is really individual to your specific responsibilities, both as a tutor and as the director.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I generally teach math when I am tutoring. A student of mine was taking an AP biology class and I was able to use the AI model to help them complete their homework and study for a test. Without the AI model, I would not have been able to assist the student as well as I did because I have little experience with that class.

AI: That sounds like a really satisfying moment - being able to help a student beyond your usual subject area. What was it about that interaction with AI that worked particularly well for you in that biology tutoring situation?

User: The AI model was able to fill in the gaps of my understanding on the particular topic. Since I was familiar with the subject area (I have taken AP biology over 10 years ago), there were only certain parts of the question that I was not able to answer. So, I was able to refresh my knowledge by using the AI and find the words to convey the material to the student in a way that made sense to me

AI: That's a great example of how AI can complement your existing knowledge and teaching skills. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have witnessed first hand how AI can become a crutch in the classroom. Several of my students use AI to help them complete assignments which causes them to have gaps in their understanding. Often this becomes a problem when they are taking tests because they did not retain the information that they regurgitated from the AI model output. 

I am a bit concerned that AI will cause me to become complacent, which is why I rarely use it during my job. Fortunately, I only have to use AI seldomly because I am well versed in the material that I tutor. I do actively consider the fact that my skills will become less sharp overtime as a result of using AI to help with my work. However, I think that using the model responsibly and honestly will provide more of a benefit than a detriment. At least until AI takes my job! lol

AI: That's such an insightful perspective - you've seen both sides of it with your students and you're being very intentional about how you use it yourself.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I imagine that in the future, there will be an AI model working besides me and all of our other instructors to use as a tool during our tutoring sessions. The way that AI can help fill in gaps in knowledge and help facilitate grading work seems too good to pass up on as a business person. From that business perspective, I think it would make our work more efficient and provide better outcomes for our clients.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on seeing AI as both a helpful gap-filler but also being mindful of not becoming too dependent on it, especially given what you've observed with your students.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I dont think so.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing the benefits of AI as a knowledge supplement while being cautious about over-dependence will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
