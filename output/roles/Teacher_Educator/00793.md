Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm part of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use it to gather examples for my students. I'm a tutor who teaches phonics, writing, and reading comprehension. So for example, with phonics, I often want a word list with a particular phonogram that says a particular sound. If I can't think of a full word list off the top of my head, I'll use AI to generate it. Another time I'm searching for examples is in my reading comprehension classes. Some students have troubles identifying irony or sarcasm in literature. I've tried to ask AI to provide excerpts from famous pieces of literature at a certain grade level that contain irony, sarcasm, or some other element. It's not too good at that yet though.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a resource generator for your teaching materials. 

Tell me more about that difference you mentioned - it sounds like AI works well for generating phonics word lists but struggles more with finding literary excerpts that contain specific elements like irony. What do you think makes those tasks so different for AI?

User: Well it's not perfect at creating phonics word lists either. If you start prohibiting phonograms that the student hasn't learned yet, adding syllable count, etc., it makes mistakes. But in general, it is better at word lists than literature. I think literature is just too broad a category, and no one has really classified vast portions of it as "sarcastic," or "character enters without being introduced." There's a whole list of things that would be useful to a reading comprehension teacher though.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the classification issue with literature sounds like a real challenge. It sounds like you have to work around AI's limitations quite a bit.

When you do use AI for these tasks, how do you typically approach it? Do you find yourself going back and forth with it to refine the results, or do you tend to give it a task and then manually edit what it gives you?

User: For literature, I go back and forth a couple times. It may come up with a viable option at some point. If it reminds me of an applicable book, I can use my own memory to describe the scene and try to get the AI to tell me what chapter it's in. After a couple tries, it sometimes lands on the correct chapter.

AI: That's a fascinating collaborative approach - you're essentially using AI as a thinking partner to help jog your own memory about books you already know. 

For the phonics word lists where AI makes mistakes with syllable counts or excluded phonograms, what do you typically do? Do you catch those errors yourself and correct them, or do you go back to AI to try to get better results?

User: Yeah, I catch them myself and just delete them. If I need more words to make up for the deletions, I can just ask. But I always double check—I'd never trust AI to accurately know the separate sounds of words by itself.

AI: So you've developed this verification system where you're always double-checking AI's work, especially for phonics. That tells me you see yourself as maintaining oversight and expertise in your domain.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your tutoring work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I could technically use AI for lesson plans or multiple choice questions. But I like the way I create them by myself. My lesson plans aren't "normal," and they're fluid—changing based on last lesson and how the child is feeling today. AI by definition gives the "normal" answer that it has learned from hundreds of examples.

AI: That's really insightful - you've identified something fundamental about AI giving "normal" answers when your work requires that personalized, adaptive approach.

Tell me more about how your lesson plans change based on how the child is feeling that day. What kinds of adjustments do you make, and what helps you recognize when those changes are needed?

User: I typically have optional activities in my lesson plan. These allow for time fluctuation in activities. I've also had moms text that they'll be 15-30 minutes late! So flexibility is a must. I also have a big repertoire of games that I can pull from (but these aren't in the lesson plans. Just in my head and ready to go if need be). For particularly difficult students, I might have 2 ideas for a lesson—one that I would like to teach, and one that we could do if they're having a really bad day.

AI: That flexibility and intuitive response to each student sounds like it draws heavily on your experience and real-time assessment skills.

How have your colleagues or the families you work with influenced the way you use AI in your tutoring work? Do they have opinions about it, or has their feedback shaped how you approach using these tools?

User: They haven't influenced my work at all. No one asks tutors if they're using AI.

AI: That's interesting - so you're essentially making these decisions about when and how to use AI entirely on your own.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I wasn't exactly frustrated, but as I mentioned before, trying to use AI to get examples of sarcasm/irony didn't go well. It sparked my memory and I found some excerpts on my own, but I remember thinking that AI was worthless when emotion, humour, or deeper understanding of literature was concerned.

AI: That's a telling moment - when AI fell short on something that requires that deeper literary understanding, you ended up relying on your own expertise to find what you needed.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not worried about that at all. I interact with students on a very personal, flexible level. It requires constant adaptation and experience. I'm never worried about some AI learning platform taking over my job. Students come to me when large group classes or some online learning platform has proven that it doesn't work well.

AI: That confidence really comes through - you've identified what makes your work uniquely human and valuable. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll find new ways to use it, or do you see it staying pretty much as it is now - mainly as a resource generator?

User: Just a resource generator, I'd say. Although I'm open to being proved wrong!

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI gives "normal" answers when your work requires that personalized, adaptive approach that responds to each individual student.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your tutoring work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's good.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the boundaries between AI assistance and human expertise - especially in personalized education - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
