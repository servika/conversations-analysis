Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good and I don't have any questions right now.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Well, as a music/guitar teacher, it fits into lesson prepping, coming up with strategies to tailor my approach to students and their needs, and for correspondence with students/parents, particularly when the response needs to be a bit longer and more delicate.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI across several different aspects of your teaching work. 

When you mention using it for lesson prepping, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? What does AI help you prepare that you might have done differently before?

User: I have plenty of prepared lesson material but there are times that I don't want to use templated material to teach my students. Every student is different and has different learning curves, interests, skill levels, etc. As such, when I do want to go off script, there are times I use AI for thinking outside of the box when coming up with lesson plans for a given student, just to give me a springboard for something I perhaps hadn't thought of or might not have thought of. For example, if I have a student who is learning quickly and I want to teach them diatonic chords without just using the boilerplate sheet with the notation/tablature I have, I might ask an AI for approaches that might be more compelling to them based on their learning habits or their musical interests, coming up with ways that would be beneficial to the student. While as an experienced teacher I can do this on my own, I do feel that I'm giving my student the best possible instruction when I am able to use not only my own ideas/experience but also integrate outside ideas I may not have thought of. There are times as well when I might be short on time and I collaborate with an AI to come up with a plan and we go back and forth tweaking things (with varying levels of involvement depending on the quality). So to answer your question in this sense, what I might have done differently before is have a limitation on my own ideas/experience, which, while still good, I think isn't as good as being comprehensive in integrating other ideas that overall are more beneficial to the student.

AI: That's a fascinating approach - using AI as a creative partner to expand beyond your own expertise rather than replace it. 

You mentioned that you collaborate with AI and go back and forth tweaking things, with "varying levels of involvement depending on the quality." Can you tell me more about what that looks like? How do you decide when to be more or less involved in that collaboration?

User: I would give the AI an idea of who the student is (age, skill level, learning habits/curve), what I need them to learn, and anything specific to them I need integrated. Then I'd see what the AI says. I just keep asking it to tweak things or change things until I'm satisfied with how it looks. I decide to be more involved when I feel the responses aren't what I'm looking for or are substandard. If something is high quality then there's obviously less of a need to involve myself as much. Perhaps worth noting, I do take what I get from the AI responses in these instances and still have to work it into an actual physical sheet by hand with chords, notation, instruction, etc. and I don't just print out whatever text it provided me. If I'm doing something like writing a song with a student, need something prepared before I start teaching, and am short on time, I also rely on the AI to write the lyrics, where I am more hands off unless there's something I really want put in there or changed.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you're using your professional judgment to evaluate and refine what AI gives you, then translating it into your actual teaching materials.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned there are times you don't want to use templated material and prefer to go off script. Are there certain aspects of your teaching that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those different for you?

User: I would say in general I want the work to still feel like my own outside of perhaps some of the exceptions I noted above such as lyrics which isn't something that integrates my expertise and what I'm actually teaching. That's fine and I don't mind stepping aside. Another example is if for some reason I'm short on time, I would rather put my ego aside and get some help (while ensuring everything is completely satisfactory) than provide a lesson that is substandard (either light on material or just relying on my sheets when there's a student who may not fully benefit from them). But beyond that, I don't want to feel like I'm simply giving my students AI based lessons. I really want what I receive from the AI to be an enhancement to what I'm doing rather than the core of what is being instructed. If I feel as though I already have what I need, I don't feel the obligation to get help with the AI and there are times I don't because I still pride myself as a good teacher and admittedly there are times I feel mixed about integrating AI into my approach (personal pride vs what might benefit the student and ultimately going with the latter even if things aren't fully integrated). Of course this is all for my lesson prepping. I don't need the AI to handle telling me how to actually instruct the students, even if technically I suppose it could. I want my own style and personality to shine and I don't need the AI to help me actually learn how to approach a student on an instructional level. I suppose this is different because I don't think the AI has as good a feel for how to approach different skill levels, personalities, learning curves, etc. as I do and I wouldn't benefit from something telling me how to approach a situation it only knows a few sentences about. I don't think my creative approaches, which have been effective, would be something the AI would think of either. So this is different to me because I don't see the benefit of integrating this.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - keeping AI as an enhancement to your expertise rather than the core of your instruction. You clearly have strong boundaries around where AI adds value versus where your personal teaching style and experience are irreplaceable.

You mentioned feeling mixed about integrating AI sometimes, with personal pride on one side and what might benefit the student on the other. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I suppose one time I was particularly satisfied is when I had a younger student who loves McDonald's (he'd speak of it often) and we were writing a song about it together, incorporating I IV V chords. I didn't really have the time to come up with a set of lyrics and have it be to the quality that I felt would be amusing to him. It would have taken me longer because I do tend to put a lot of thought into writing song lyrics where it takes longer. I gave the AI what I needed, asking for the lyrics to be funny and appropriate for his age, and was given something I really thought was very creative and funny. I altered a few things but mostly kept it in tact. The lyrics went over really well with him and because they engaged him so much he also was fully engaged in the part where we collaborated on putting the chords and a little melody to the lyrics. In turn, he made great strides in his understanding of the concept and of his fingering of and switching between those three chords we used because he wanted to be able to do the song (with those funny lyrics) with good timing.

AI: That's a wonderful example! It sounds like the AI helped you create something that was both time-efficient and highly engaging for your student - and ultimately led to better learning outcomes because he was so motivated by the material.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself discussing these tools with other music teachers, or is this something you've been exploring more independently?

User: I have only discussed this with one music teacher (a fellow teacher who primarily teaches guitar, who is about 25 years older than I am and with a lot of experience) and he seemed pretty intrigued by it and open to the concept of using it in the same way I do, where you sort of augment what you have/have further suggestions outside of the box for students with more unique needs than actually outright relying on it. I haven't followed up too much with him on it, however, and I'm not particularly motivated to discuss it in depth with others. I don't think any outside factors have actually influenced the way I use AI.

AI: That's interesting that you've kept your AI exploration relatively independent. It sounds like when you did share it, there was openness to the concept, especially around that idea of augmentation rather than replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops, or do you think you'll stick with the current approach you've described?

User: I think more than likely my approach will remain the same. I feel happy with how I'm utilizing it and because I do still take pride in my work and what I do, I don't want it to be something that stifles my own creativity or approach if it becomes a crutch. And I don't want to be charging students for lessons that are too strongly AI influenced.

AI: That makes sense - you've found a balance that works for you and maintains the integrity of what you're providing your students.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it feel more natural given your approach?

User: I don't think about it. I've been at this a long time and feel comfortable with where I am. My skills will always be sharp and if I feel I could improve on anything, I will do so in a way that they are my own skills that I don't need to rely on anything for.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as an enhancement rather than replacement, and how you maintain clear boundaries around preserving your own teaching style and creative approaches.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining your professional identity and the quality of your student relationships will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated how candid you were about the mixed feelings around integration and your thoughtful approach to ensuring AI enhances rather than replaces your expertise. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
