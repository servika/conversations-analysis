Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I've been working on a project to develop better controls for IHC staining used in medical diagnosis. The project is primarily focused on improving accuracy and precision in cancer diagnosis but will likely be applicable to other areas.

AI: That sounds like really important work. Tell me more about what that process looked like - from when you first had the idea to improve IHC staining controls to where you are now with the project.

User: The idea grew out of other work that my lab was already doing. We knew that lack of reliable controls (both positive and negative) is a general problem with using IHC staining for diagnosis. The initial idea was something of a "light bulb" moment so we immediately shifted some of our work in other areas to this project. The first phase involved general viability investigation through literature and patent searchers. Once we were confident that the idea had serious merit and wasn't already something that was in use or patented we decided to proceed. A section of the laboratory was partitioned off as dedicated space, appropriate personnel were assigned to the project, and we began developing research plans and budgets for the work. The project is now in its third year.

AI: That's a fascinating journey from that initial light bulb moment to where you are now in year three. I'm curious - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? This could be during your literature searches, research planning, data analysis, or any other part of the workflow you just described.

User: Our primary use of AI has been in literature search and patent evaluation. Because this is a new idea, we have been using AI to identify work in similar areas and create summaries of those publications for quick evaluation by humans.

AI: That makes a lot of sense for speeding up that initial research phase. For those literature searches and patent evaluations specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for finding and summarizing relevant work.

User: Because this project involves a wide range of research techniques that we didn't have already set up and running in the lab, we used AI to search and summarize information in areas where our expertise was lacking. For instance, we knew that the project would require insect cell culture but none of had experience in that area. We used AI to help us to select the appropriate cell types and culture conditions that were necessary for the work.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a way to quickly get up to speed in areas outside your core expertise. It sounds like AI became a bridge to knowledge you needed but didn't have in-house.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the actual experimental work, data analysis, or other aspects of the project - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: We're still not 100% convinced that AI is reliable enough to replace a human when it comes to things like data analysis. We've seen several instances where AI has produced summaries of papers or patents that were misleading or contained outright incorrect information. Our confidence in AI just isn't high enough at the moment to trust it with our data. We're also a commercial entity so there a bit of concern over confidentially with data that we might share with an AI system.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns - both the reliability issues you've experienced firsthand and the confidentiality considerations as a commercial entity. 

When you have used AI for those literature searches and patent summaries, how do you verify or validate what it produces, especially given that you've caught misleading or incorrect information before?

User: We only use summaries produced by the AI system as a quick screen for publications that we might have interest in. For instance, AI has been extremely good at helping us quickly identify papers using the particular cells lines were using. Humans use the summaries to pick out interesting publications and then pull the full text for a thorough review.

AI: That's a smart approach - using AI as an initial screening tool rather than as the final word. It sounds like you've found that sweet spot where AI adds value while still maintaining human oversight.

We're about halfway through our conversation now, and I'm really getting a clear picture of how you're thoughtfully integrating AI into specific parts of your workflow.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - whether that's because of reliability concerns, confidentiality issues, or it just doesn't exist yet - what would that be and why?

User: The place we could really use AI's help is in protocol development. It would be great to simply ask AI things like "What's the most often used method for purifying XXX?" or "Help me develop a protocol for FPLC separation of this protein." Unfortunately, our attempts at asking those kinds of questions have led to unsatisfactory answers.

AI: That's such a specific and valuable use case - having AI help with the nuts and bolts of experimental design and protocol development. It sounds like there's real potential there, but the current quality isn't meeting your standards.

When you say the answers have been unsatisfactory, what exactly was missing or problematic about the protocols or methods AI suggested? Was it that they were too generic, outdated, or something else entirely?

User: The answers in this area we've gotten back from AI have often included incomplete information. For instance, purification protocols will sometimes be missing a critical step or important variables such as temperature. It seems that AI is correctly identifying the problems we're giving it, but it's not quite to the point where it can fully identify what's important to include in an answer.

AI: That's a really insightful observation - AI recognizing the problem correctly but missing those crucial details that make the difference between a protocol that works and one that fails in the lab.

Those are all my questions, and your perspectives on how you're strategically using AI as a screening tool while being thoughtful about its limitations have been particularly insightful. You've painted a clear picture of someone who's found practical value in AI while maintaining appropriate skepticism based on real experience.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Nope. I think that's all.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a screening tool while maintaining rigorous human oversight, and especially your point about AI missing critical protocol details, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

It's clear you've developed a very practical and measured approach to AI integration - leveraging its strengths for literature screening while being appropriately cautious about areas where reliability and completeness are critical.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
