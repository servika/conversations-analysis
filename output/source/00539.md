Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sure, let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I do freelance work for several different clients I've collected over the years, and new ones that get referred to me by existing clients. So, some of the work is marketing and communications related, and other work is as a research assistant and I also do data analytics and create reports and proposals/presentations for other projects. I have developed different skillsets over the years and figure out what my clients need and then do it for them.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse mix of work across different domains. 

When you're juggling all these different types of projects - the marketing, research assistance, data analytics, reports and proposals - how does AI specifically help you with each of these? Are there particular tasks within these areas where you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Usually my client has a problem to solve or an end goal in mind, so I have a good idea of the deliverables they need (they are often mid or upper level management at their company or agency and don't have the time or skills to figure it all out). Sometimes they want me to create the project pitch or proposal, and other times they have all kinds of assets they need me to do something with. Either way, I usually use AI first to describe to the model that I'm starting a new work project and then explain the desired end product, deliverables, or what assets I have been given to work with and then ask for an outline or suggestions on how to approach the whole thing. Then I continue to go back and forth between other platforms where I'm constructing and saving my work product, and the AI chat to continue to ask for assistance with next steps.

AI: That's a really interesting workflow - using AI as almost a strategic planning partner at the start and then continuing that conversation as you work through the project.

When you're going back and forth between your work platforms and the AI chat for those next steps, what does that collaboration typically look like? Are you bringing specific chunks of work back to get feedback, or asking for help when you hit roadblocks, or something else entirely?

User: Sometimes I'm able to paste details of the work or project directly into the AI chat, but most of the time I'm working under NDA or with confidential data and PII so I have to usually just describe where I am at in the suggested workflow and what roadblock I've hit and what to try next to overcome it or for a workaround.

AI: Ah, that's a really important constraint I hadn't considered - the confidentiality and NDA requirements. 

So when you can't share the actual work but need to describe where you are in the workflow, how do you find that process? Are you able to get the help you need by describing the situation in general terms, or do you sometimes feel limited by not being able to share the specifics?

User: Yes, it can take extra time and effort, but using AI still is SO much faster and more helpful than in the past when I'd have to Google everything that I was stuck on or read a ton of articles on best practices or find examples of the type of work I was trying to product.

AI: That's such a compelling comparison - the difference between having to piece together information from multiple Google searches and articles versus having that conversational back-and-forth with AI.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: When I have to do a lot of writing (like copy for a deck or slideshow, or the intro on a proposal) I generally prefer to start with my own writing sample and ask AI to improve it or tell me what I'm missing, based on what it knows about how I described the project at the start. If it's captions for charts and graphs, I will usually give the images to the AI and ask it to generate captions or explanations for what the data show. Sometimes I change the names of the data labels and variables to protect confidential info. But it's still helpful for making sure I'm explaining the results and overall data relationships accurately.

AI: That distinction you're making is really interesting - preferring to start with your own writing for things like copy and proposals, but being more willing to let AI generate captions and explanations for data visualizations.

What is it about those writing tasks that makes you want to put your own voice or perspective in first? What feels different about that compared to having AI help explain data relationships?

User: A lot of my work is for clients I've freelanced for for years so they know my work style and voice or I know theirs if they are outsourcing work to me and then submitting it as their own, so it's easier to start with a style of writing that I have in mind and then let AI improve the quality and clarity, rather than trying to start by describing the writing style or voice I want without any sample work to start from

AI: That makes so much sense - you've developed these ongoing relationships where your writing voice or understanding of their voice becomes part of the value you provide. Starting with that foundation and then using AI to refine and enhance it preserves that relationship element.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like you have this collaborative back-and-forth throughout a project, but I'm wondering - are you more likely to work through tasks step-by-step with AI, or do you tend to delegate complete sections for it to handle independently?

User: Once I have started by describing a new project or assignment I'm starting, and what the end goal is, I ask for suggestions on how to do it, and for a simple workflow outline. Once I see that, I will tell the AI if I've already done the first step or steps and show them what I have or describe it. It will then usually either offer to do the next step for me, or it will ask if I want help with the next step.

AI: That sounds like a really natural flow where the AI is picking up on your progress and either proactively offering help or checking in about what you need next.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you're freelancing for different clients, I'm curious if different clients have different attitudes about AI use, or if that affects how open you are about using it?

User: To be honest, I don't really discuss with my clients about how or when I use AI to guide and assist me with my project work. I work from home and usually just email or chat message with my contacts on a project if I have questions, need assets or login access to something, and to update them on my progress. They have work they want done that they don't want to figure out or manage themselves and their team is working on other things, so they just ask me if I can do XYZ for them and I usually can. This can be creating an ad campaign proposal and content calendar, working on RFP or specific parts or an RFP they are submitting, or doing the analytics and viz for a presentation they need for a big meeting or a conference they are presenting at. I've had clients ask me to do a quick flyer or brochure because their graphic designer is out and they don't want to use a temp agency, and even had siblings or children of my clients want help writing their resumes or creating professional bios. No one ever asks how I'm going to approach or complete the work. They just want it done well and when they need it. I guess I'm like a virtual assistant and AI is MY virtual assistant lol

AI: That's such a vivid way to put it - you're like a virtual assistant and AI is YOUR virtual assistant! That hierarchy is really interesting.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can think of an example that I can give you without breaching any confidentiality. A client wanted some data about levels of awareness on a certain subject broken down by different demographic groups. They were making a case about something they were pitching at work and they didn't find what they needed to support or refute their idea/position so they asked me to look into it and send them a summary of what the data show. I did lots of deep research with a couple different models but it turned out no one had ever done any surveys, focus groups, retrospective studies or anything that would give data answering the question I was asking. The model I found most satisfying was the one that proactively suggested that it could create a brief research proposal on how to gather the info needed to make the business decisions/case my client was concerned about. It ended up creating a great project outline, including cost estimates, timing, etc. for different paths we could take (do an online consumer survey, conduct a few focus groups, etc). It then offered to create all the research materials I would need once I decided which path(s) to take. I was able to go back to my client and say, if you need to make a case about this or answer this question, the data doesn't already exist, but I can give you everything

AI: That's a fascinating example - the AI not only recognized that the data didn't exist but proactively suggested creating a research plan to generate it. That kind of problem-solving partnership sounds really valuable.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it factor into how you approach your work?

User: Honestly, just by continuing to use AI, I've been made aware of what I need to know or learn in order to keep up with it. Sometimes a model will ask something I don't know about and I take that opportunity to use the AI to explain it to me or tell me what the different options are.  I feel like as AI evolves, as long as I keep using it, I will keep maintaining and developing relevant skills. Some of my clients have figured out how to use AI well themselves, but others still just use it like a search engine or to do very basic calculations

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as both a tool and a teacher to stay current. It sounds like you see your clients at different stages of AI adoption too.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing the types of projects you take on or how you position yourself with clients?

User: I mostly work by repeat business or referrals and don't do any selling or pitching of my services, so I don't really worry about positioning myself. Most of them will have something they want to get off their plate and want to know if I can do it, and I look at their request and decide (with AI help) if I can tackle it and then get back to them with what I can deliver, when and for how much. Just like how they don't ask me if I'm using Google docs or Word, SQL, R or Python, they don't care if I'm using AI tools, as long as I'm not exposing any proprietary or identifying information in the process.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has become like your own virtual assistant while you serve as one for your clients - that dynamic really captures something interesting about these layered working relationships.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Only that I've been toying with the idea of offering services to "train" a few of my clients in how to use AI. Maybe creating some tutorials for specific use cases that come up a lot. That would mean that they could do some of my work themselves, but they would also appreciate that I've identified a need they have and am offering to help them solve it. I used to do the same thing years ago with email marketing and Google Analytics as they because more self-serve for non-power users

AI: That's such an interesting evolution - recognizing that teaching your clients to use AI more effectively could actually strengthen your relationships with them, even if it means they might handle some tasks themselves. It shows how you've adapted to technological shifts before and are thinking strategically about doing it again.

Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experiences so openly. Your insights about working as a freelancer with AI, navigating confidentiality constraints, and that collaborative workflow you've developed will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you walking me through your process and being so thoughtful about how these tools fit into your work life.

User: Thanks! This has been really fun and interesting

AI: I'm so glad you enjoyed it! It was really engaging for me too - your examples and the way you think about AI as a collaborative partner gave me a lot to think about. Thanks again for sharing your time and insights with us!
