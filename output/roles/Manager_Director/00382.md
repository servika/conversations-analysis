Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sure, lets begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to summarize longer emails sent to me by team members, so I can make sure that I am understanding the project details correctly. I also use AI to help me draft the codebases for some software projects.

AI: That's really helpful to understand. When you say you use AI to help draft codebases for software projects, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: When I'm working with AI to draft the codebase, I usually send AI the project description, and then I send the AI a note with some additional information about the project that my manager has told me. After that, I let the AI generate the codebase template/ file library structure, and refine further as needed.

AI: That sounds like a pretty structured approach. When you get to that refinement stage - where you're working with what the AI has generated - what does that collaboration typically involve? Are you making tweaks yourself, or are you going back and forth with the AI to iterate on the code?

User: That depends on what specific feature I am trying to implement to the codebase. If I have specific plan on how I want a feature implemented, I'll do the tweak myself, but if I'm less specific with an implementation, and want to try different versions, I'll go back and worth with the AI.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you adjust your approach based on how clear your vision is for the implementation. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: For anything related to writing code, I am always willing to work with AI. For other tasks, like scheduling, and writing emails I usually do them myself. Some longer email tasks, like writing up project reports, I'll still use AI for drafting.

AI: Interesting - so you're very open to AI collaboration for coding, but more selective with other types of work tasks. What is it about scheduling and writing regular emails that makes you prefer handling those yourself?

User: These tasks feel simple enough that I'm not sure if using AI will actually save me much time.

AI: That's a practical perspective - the time investment versus time saved calculation. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: Workplace culture has definitely caused me to use AI a bit more with coding projects, since we get free access to some good AI models with our work accounts.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A time using AI felt particularly satisfying was when I had been tasked with implementing a database feature to one of the software projects, because I was unfamiliar with that specific type of database, so the AI was really helpful for the task.

AI: That sounds like a really good match between what you needed and what AI could provide. What made that experience work so well - was it the AI's knowledge of that specific database type, or something about how the interaction went?

User: Yeah, the AI had some great knowledge about ChromaDB, which helped me to implement the feature in a timely manner. Without AI assistance, the task could've taken a lot longer.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't spend too much extra time with maintaining skills in areas where AI could take over. AI will probably continue to get better at coding at a rate faster than me.

AI: That's a pragmatic way to look at it. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Since I work in software I envision that my relationship with AI at work will continue to grow stronger since I will be using AI more and more with my projects.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you adjust your collaboration style based on how specific your implementation plans are - that flexibility seems really strategic.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no, I think thats all

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you strategically use AI for coding tasks - especially for unfamiliar technologies like ChromaDB - and your practical approach to evaluating when AI is worth the time investment will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
