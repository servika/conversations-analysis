Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. Please begin.

AI: Great, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In my bookkeeping business we are experimenting with AI to make common tasks more efficient. We use AI for scanning and loading paper documents that we receive. As well, we use AI for generating communications. For communications, we typically provide an outline of a message, then make multiple edits to the text until it is usable. Lastly, we will use AI to help with driving attention to unusual items or highlights in financial results that require attention.

AI: That's a really interesting range of applications. I'd like to understand more about that communication process you described. When you say you make multiple edits to the text until it's usable, what does that back-and-forth typically look like?

User: We tend to use common language to request changes. Most often, the changes have to do with intent and tone. We need professional sounding communications. Therefore, we will ask for small iterative changes to the responses until it fits our intent. We also find that AI communications often have signs in the language that make them appear to have been written by AI. Therefore, we will often re-write the final prompt response in our own language. This is time consuming, but typically produces high quality result.

AI: That's really insightful about the tone and making it sound more natural. You mentioned that even after all those iterations, you often end up rewriting the final response in your own language because of those AI "tells." What are some of those signs that tip you off that something was written by AI?

User: As an example, though better now, the AI communications often added in initial greetings text or outro text that attempted to personalize the message. This approach did not replicate common communication processes, but may have been a programmers idea to make the AI responses sound more human-like.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those formulaic greetings and outros that don't match how you'd actually communicate with your clients.

Shifting gears a bit, I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your bookkeeping work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: In bookkeeping, there remains a purely manual task of capturing paper-based information. Less organized clients often have paper copies of statements and receipts. We still need to manually capture these (scanning, etc.). But, we then heavily rely on AI to understand and extract information from the captured documents. I do not know of a way that AI can help with the manual work yet.

AI: That's a clear distinction - the physical handling versus the information processing. 

When you are using AI for those tasks it can help with - like extracting information from documents or generating communications - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to work back and forth with the AI throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete task and let it handle it independently before you review the results?

User: At this point, I feel that a lot of back and forth is still required. I come across too many errors in the information extraction and need to perform manual validations to be happy with the results. One way I go back and forth is that I will provide feedback (and sometimes direction) on what the error was, how the error was corrected, and guidance on how I would like it to handle this situation in the future.

AI: That training approach sounds really hands-on. You're essentially coaching the AI based on the specific errors you're catching. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been any particular reaction or approach from others that's shaped how you integrate these tools?

User: We are a small business (but, I come from IT in a large corporation). As a principle in this business, I am always interested in efficiency and capacity growth. This mindset has encourage significant use of AI. But, we are held back by the amount of time that experimentation or trial and error takes to get to the desired outcome. Sometimes, processes are still manual due to this time commitment. But, I see the capabilities changing fast and am always ready to try new opportunities.

AI: That IT background really comes through in how you're approaching this - you can see the potential but you're also realistic about the current time investment needed.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time we used AI with a new client's paper-based records. In this case, the client had a mix of business and personal transactions and we needed to filter out the personal based on a number of factors including transaction-level designation by the client. Unfortunately, the client had not been overly accurate. The AI information capture recognized inconsistencies, brought them to our attention and then after some iteration identified other transactions that had also been misclassified in the initial processing. This was many hundreds of paper inputs and saved us significant time and many future issues.

AI: That sounds like a really powerful example of AI not just processing information but actually improving the quality of the work by catching inconsistencies you might have missed otherwise.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you integrate more AI into your processes?

User: My focus for training and learning has definitely shifted over the last couple years. I still want to have the skills in these areas as I want to know that it is being done right. But, I have spent way more time than expected learning how to build and manage prompts to get the expected results. As well, I am learning more people skills now, as how we interact with our clients becomes more important when more of the work can be "automated" through AI.

AI: That's fascinating - you're essentially developing new skill sets around prompt engineering and client interaction while maintaining your core expertise as a quality check. The shift toward people skills as a differentiator is really interesting.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for your business?

User: I see AI doing much more of the "work" of bookkeeping. It can follow instructions and accounting rules potentially better than employees. But, for the near future, we will still require significant effort to validate the results and communicate with our clients.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you're actively training the AI through feedback loops and how your skill development focus has shifted toward prompt engineering and client relationships.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your bookkeeping work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. Thank you for the conversation.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the iterative training process, the shift in skill requirements, and how AI is changing client relationships will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
