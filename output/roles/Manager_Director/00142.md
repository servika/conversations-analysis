Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions, thank you.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In my daily work as a construction rental store manager I typically use AI for solutions and tutorials on how to use new equipment and devices I'm not familiar with, while I don't use AI too often, I do use it.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a knowledge resource for unfamiliar equipment. 

Can you walk me through what that looks like? When you encounter a new piece of equipment, how do you typically interact with AI to get the information you need?

User: Sometimes we get new items for our fleet that I'm unfamiliar with, so I will use ChatGPT to ask it for reviews of the item (like the new Mud Mixer), common issues, and links to Youtube of people using it.

AI: That's a smart approach - getting multiple angles on the equipment before you need to help customers with it.

When you're asking ChatGPT about these new items, are you looking for this information so you can then explain it to customers yourself, or are there times when you might show customers the AI responses directly?

User: I never show the customers the direct AI explanations, instead I give them my interpretation.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're using AI as research to build your own expertise rather than passing it along directly.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: While I prefer to manage some tasks myself such as hyper specific research on concrete curing products due to the nature of the concrete business and how critical it is to supply the right product to not ruing a job.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making - the high-stakes nature of concrete work where the wrong information could have serious consequences.

Tell me more about that. What is it specifically about those concrete curing situations that makes you feel like you need to handle the research yourself rather than relying on AI?

User: Concrete is a huge aspect of our business financially, concrete work is one of the biggest parts of construction and costs the most as well, so naturally it is important to take extra care of those clients. As far as concrete curing products and sealing products go, recommending the right product is critical to ensure not only is the client happy, but that the client does go on a job and use the wrong sealer or cure and have to repour a whole job site because the concrete came out wrong or didn't last.

AI: That really illustrates the weight of responsibility you carry - where your recommendations directly impact whether a client's expensive project succeeds or fails.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Typically its collaborative, for basic questions that aren't critical but I'm familiar with, I'll use the Google AI summary for a quick overview and the more advanced questions and tutorials I'll use ChatGPT. I also use ChatGPT to draft apology emails in case anything goes wrong with a rental or sale, as well as using GPT for posting quick descriptions about fleet items, which would be more independent work.

AI: That's a helpful breakdown - it sounds like you've developed different strategies depending on the complexity and stakes involved.

You mentioned using ChatGPT for drafting apology emails when things go wrong with rentals. Can you tell me more about how that works? What does that process look like when you're dealing with a situation that needs an apology?

User: Sometimes when a client rents a machine, like a skid loader, it breaks down and as a manager I want to maintain customer retention so I will reach out with an apology email. Typically I will tell GPT the name of the client and their company and tell it to write a deep apology on behalf of our company, and provide a parameter to offer a x% discount on the next rental at the end.

AI: That sounds like a practical way to handle those difficult situations quickly while maintaining a professional tone.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others at your store use AI similarly, or are you finding your own approach?

User: It's only me at the workplace using AI currently, I'm much younger than everyone else here.

AI: That's an interesting dynamic - being the only one using AI in your workplace.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well the Mud Mixer experience I had with ChatGPT was particularly successful, as GPT summarized that it takes 1 minute to mix concrete bags and mentioned the biggest issue is people misusing the machine and accidentally breaking it fairly easily.

AI: That sounds like exactly the kind of information you needed to help customers use the equipment properly and avoid costly breakdowns.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I've always been more of a hands on person and big on the in-person experience for clients, so I'm not worried.

AI: That's a confident perspective - focusing on the human connection and hands-on expertise that AI can't replicate.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think AI will mostly begin to replace some of the financial burden I share with owner, such as paying bills, as well as the overall revenue and depreciation on the business.

AI: That's fascinating - you're thinking about AI taking on more of the backend financial operations rather than the customer-facing work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you handle high-stakes situations like concrete products differently from routine equipment questions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that is all from me, thank you.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you balance AI assistance with hands-on expertise, especially in high-stakes situations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated learning about your thoughtful approach to when to use AI versus when to rely on your own judgment. Have a great rest of your day!
