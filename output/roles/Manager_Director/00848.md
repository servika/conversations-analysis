Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great, let's dive in then. 

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I use AI in a variety of ways during my typical workday.  I'm a Project Manager and I do business development, so depending on what I'm working on, the tasks vary.   For my project management side, I've used it to do simple things like take my thoughts on one of my subordinates and convert that into a write up for either an award or for an annual performance review.  I also use it when I'm screening candidates for open positions (and to write the job reqs that I'll be posting.    This past week, I needed to post 11 job reqs, and screen over 50 resumes that came in for them.  On the business development side, I use it for a variety of tasks.  From the beginning, I'll take the RFP or RFQ and throw it into ChatGPT, and then I have a voice conversation with the AI while I'm commuting to the office to help me understand the RFP and to figure out what the scope is, what the key points are, and help to develop a plan.   Once I move on to the next phase, I'll send a capabilities overview and some contracts that we currently have and see what the AI thinks would be applicable to the new RFP.   I also use it for simple things like rewriting emails, rewording parts of the proposals that I've already written, and for asking questions and discussing issues that I run into daily.

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of uses across both sides of your role. I'm particularly intrigued by how you use voice conversations with AI during your commute to work through RFPs. 

Tell me more about that process - what does that conversation typically look like when you're driving to the office?

User: So how I usually do it is send the RFP and PWS to it and after I do that I'll start a voice conversation with it.  I first ask it to give me an overview of the opportunity, focusing on the scope and the main tasks of the RFP.  Then I'll ask it what it thinks is the key focus or "foot stomp" items in the document.  Then I'll go into the Section L and M and ask about the evaluation process and the requirements for it.  If there's a technical approach, I'll have it review that with me.   After the initial reviews, I'll go more into depth with the specific paragraphs in the scope and ask questions that help lead me to my initial approach to our proposal.

AI: That sounds like a very systematic approach to breaking down complex documents. When you're having those voice conversations and drilling down into specific paragraphs, how does the back-and-forth feel? Are you finding that the AI is keeping up with the nuances of what you're looking for, or do you find yourself having to redirect it frequently?

User: Yeah, I definitely feel like it's keeping up with the nuances of what I'm looking for.  For example, the last one that I reviewed had 6 main parts to it.  I went through part by part, and regularly referred back to the earlier sections and it kept up with me, and remembered exactly what I was looking for.  It also picks up on my approach as I'm going through it, so I can ask questions like "How does this fit into my approach" or "What could I include from this specific section that will strengthen my approach"

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like the AI is not just processing information but actually learning your strategic thinking as you go. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think the biggest thing that I prefer to handle myself is the personal aspects of managing employees.  So with the performance evals I mentioned earlier, I know my employees, so I want to provide all of the input and just have it shape it into a nicer sounding format.  I also tend to do the financial tasks on my own, just so any sensitive info remains on company servers/computers.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping the human judgment and relationship knowledge for employee management, and maintaining security around financial information. 

When you do use AI for work tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I lean more towards collaborating.  I like to have the final look at everything before I send it out, so I use it more as a partner than a subordinate

AI: That's an interesting distinction - using it as a partner rather than a subordinate. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: They haven't really influenced it much, as I've adopted using AI at my company in the ways that I do earlier than all of my colleagues.  I do feel like I've influenced them though.  I share what I do with my team, as well as my peers in the company to show them how much easier things are.  Luckily my workplace has started leaning more into AI for different tasks, not just LLMs either, so it's starting to be used much more often

AI: So you've been something of a trailblazer in your organization. It sounds like you've taken on an informal role of showing others the possibilities.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've had mostly positive experiences with AI in the ways that I use it lately, but when I first started my RFP review process (prior to having voice conversations), it would forget what I was doing or act like it didn't have access to the files that I sent. Luckily, that doesn't really happen at all anymore.   For a time that I was satisfied, it would probably be when I was doing a review of a proposal (I also review proposals other capture managers are submitting when I'm not working on them).  I went through and did my personal review and caught quite a few things that needed to be changed, but then I put it into an AI and it found a ton of things that I didn't catch, from inconsistencies with earlier sections in the proposal, to misleading sentences or sentences that didn't make sense.  Doing it this way saved me a good 1-2 hours, so it was nice.

AI: That's a great example of how AI can catch things that even an experienced eye might miss. It sounds like it's become a real force multiplier for your review process.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I haven't really considered it much, there are many aspects of my job that an AI could take over, but there are even more that it couldn't, at least right now.  So I've been leaning into the areas that it could take over and really leveraging it for them, that way I'm ahead of the curve.

AI: That's a really forward-thinking approach - rather than worrying about displacement, you're positioning yourself to be more effective by embracing the collaboration.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think that it will continue to make my work easier.  I think that one day in the near future, I'll be able to have an AI that has an in-depth knowledge of my company, our capabilities, and our past performance that will be able to find relevant RFPs, use it's existing knowledge, and write out the proposal for me to review and make changes.  I don't think it will evolve much on the personal/relationship side of the job though, but it may be able to grow my understanding of what motivates my employees and provide recommendations on how I can better lead.

AI: That vision of an AI with deep institutional knowledge that can proactively identify opportunities and draft proposals sounds really compelling - almost like having a highly knowledgeable research assistant who never forgets anything.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being a collaborative partner rather than treating AI as a subordinate, and how you've become an advocate for AI adoption in your organization.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, nothing that I can think of

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner, particularly your systematic approach to RFP analysis and your role as an early adopter in your organization, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
