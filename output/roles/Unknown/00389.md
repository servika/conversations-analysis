Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in investor relations for a publicly traded company.  I use AI to parse through competitor documents looking for trends over time and trends common amongst different companies in a given time period.  I also use AI to help me write drafts of our own earnings call scripts.

AI: That sounds like AI is helping you with some really analytical work. When you're parsing through those competitor documents, what does that process actually look like for you? Walk me through how you tackle that with AI.

User: I either provide the assistant with keywords, ask the assistant questions or have it come up with its own analysis about trends over time.

AI: Tell me more about that analysis process. When you have the AI come up with its own analysis about trends, what does that interaction look like between you and the AI? Are you going back and forth with it, or do you give it the documents and let it run with the analysis?

User: I provide the documents and I do a little of both.  I am definitely asking questions but I am also looking for the assistant  to provide its own input.  I am basically testing how intelligent the assistant is.

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned testing how intelligent the assistant is. What are you looking for when you do that testing? How do you know when the AI has passed or failed that intelligence test?

User: Once the assistant calls out a trend I dig deeper into the data to confirm that trend.

AI: So you're doing your own verification work after the AI identifies something. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your investor relations work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to do my own final draft writing.  I feel like it is still too easy to spot when AI has written a document and AI still isn't good enough to capture nuanced language.  I can also better incorporate strategy and messaging than the AI can.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you want that final polish and strategic messaging to come from you. When you do use AI for those initial drafts of earnings call scripts, how do you typically work with it? Do you collaborate back and forth during the drafting process, or do you have it create a complete first draft and then you take over from there?

User: I collaborate back and forth during the drafting process.  I am looking for the assistant to help me rather than replace me.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like it works well for you. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others at your company using it similarly, or do you find yourself navigating this differently than your peers?

User: For this aspect AI is not allowed to be used on the company platform.  It is my understanding that anything written on an AI platform becomes open access so there is some confidentiality issues in place.  I have to use my own device and leave out any company specific references.

AI: That's a significant constraint to work around. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Using AI to parse through large documents or large amounts of data is very helpful and satisfying.  AI being used for this purpose provides a huge time savings.

AI: That time savings sounds really valuable. On the flip side, have you had any frustrating experiences with AI in your work? Situations where it didn't meet your expectations or created more work for you?

User: The output created by AI still must be checked.  It does make errors at time that must be caught.  I view AI currently as a tool rather than a total replacement.

AI: That perspective on AI as a tool rather than replacement is really clear from how you've described your work. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Being adaptable and flexible are key.  AI is meant to make you more productive rather than put you out of a job altogether.  AI still can't replace customer relationships and the human element of the job.

AI: That's a thoughtful way to look at it - focusing on those uniquely human aspects. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future?

User: As AI becomes more intelligent it will play a much bigger role in my day to day production.  Using AI is partly about your trust in the output it creates.  The more you trust the output the bigger role it will have in my work place.

AI: That relationship between trust and usage makes a lot of sense. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how trust in the AI's output directly influences how much you rely on it, and your clear distinction between using AI as a productive tool versus a replacement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating confidentiality constraints, the importance of verification, and how trust builds over time with AI tools will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
