Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds like a plan, let's begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: For the most part, I use AI as a pair programmer/coding agent and I use AI for feedback about specific approaches to solving problems with code.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI in both collaborative and consultative ways with your programming work.

When you mention using it as a pair programmer versus getting feedback on approaches, can you walk me through what that looks like in practice? How do those two different uses actually play out during your day?

User: I have an AI model set up to autocomplete code as I write it.  I have this enabled about 50% of the time.  When I have a multistep task that I know would take me longer to implement AND I know that the model I'm working with is capable, I will prompt a coding agent to handle that task.  Both of these occur exclusively in my IDE (Usually VS Code).

Now, when it comes to feedback, I use that on more complicated problems.  I've usually got a scenario that I'm trying to optimize an approach to.  I'll summarize how the codebase works and describe the problem I'm working on.  Then I'll list any theories I have on the best approach and send this as a prompt to a mainstream model (Such as one available through a webpage).  I usually ask for feedback on each approach and if there are any better approaches that I haven't thought of.

AI: That's a really clear breakdown of how you've structured your AI usage. I'm curious about that 50% figure you mentioned for autocomplete - what determines when you choose to have it enabled versus when you turn it off?

User: around 80% of the time, autocomplete is a helpful feature that speeds up getting what's in my head into the computer.  But sometimes, such as when tweaking multiple lines, the autocomplete constantly makes suggestions.  This often leads to a suggestion popping up right as I click somewhere and it ruins what I have highlighted or where my multiple cursors are.  So the 20% where I don't use it is when it gets annoying in this regard.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like there's a real tension between the efficiency gains and those moments where the timing just doesn't work with your workflow.

Shifting gears a bit, I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain programming tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I enjoy coding and I especially enjoy tackling new problems that I've never encountered.  If I can imagine, entirely, what I would do in my head, I tend to assign those tasks to agents.  But if the approach requires something that I've never worked with, such as a specific web api, I usually handle those myself.  This is where the feedback method can often come into play.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction - it sounds like you're drawn to the learning and discovery aspects of coding, particularly when encountering something new.

When you do tackle those unfamiliar challenges yourself, like working with a new web API, tell me more about how the feedback method comes into play. What does that process look like when you're navigating uncharted territory?

User: Usually it comes down to me finding multiple ways of solving a single problem and wanting to know the pros and cons of each.  It can save a lot of time intensive refactoring in the future rather than just blindly coding.

AI: That's really smart - using AI as a strategic sounding board before you commit to an approach. It sounds like you're being quite deliberate about when and how you engage with AI.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'm far more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task.  Iterative prompting usually yields far better results, in every use use case, not just mine.  I'd rather work with AI to build an amazing final solution that delegate a huge undertaking to it and spend hours making corrections.

AI: That iterative approach sounds really thoughtful. I'm curious about the collaborative dynamic you've developed - when you're working through those iterations, what does that back-and-forth actually look like? How do you know when to push back or when to accept what the AI suggests?

User: I generally ask the agent to act on a prompt.  It writes to code, and I review it.  Then, I usually have my own part to play where I'll continue working on a specific part of the task.  When I'm happy with where I'm at, I'll prompt again for the next thing the AI can help me speed up.\

AI: That workflow makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you've found a rhythm where you're leveraging AI's strengths while keeping yourself in the driver's seat for the overall direction.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been any particular encouragement, resistance, or just general attitudes that have shaped your approach?

User: I'm self-employed as a software engineer and I usually build websites for individuals or small companies.  So there's not really a workplace culture or colleagues I have to deal with.

AI: Ah, that's a really important context - being self-employed gives you complete autonomy over how you integrate AI into your work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have a project that I'm particularly proud of, an emulator for the Heathkit ET-3400 that runs in a web browser.  It simulates CPU cycles and actually runs the MPU as if it were a real chip (e.g. it's not state based, it uses a fetch decode execute cycle).  It's a bit frustrating to use AI with because AI are naturally good at working with state based systems and they have no way of interpreting or debugging an FDE cycle.  Especially when it can process 20,000+ instructions per second.

AI: That's a really fascinating project - an MPU emulator with full fetch-decode-execute cycles is quite an accomplishment! 

I can see how that would be frustrating when AI doesn't have the mental model to work with that kind of real-time, cycle-accurate system. When you hit those limitations with AI on a project like that, how do you adapt? Do you find yourself falling back to more traditional debugging approaches, or have you found ways to work around AI's blind spots?

User: So far no AI model has been able to interact with the software in a helpful manner.  I constantly test new models as they are released almost like a benchmark.  But currently I have to result to manual coding.

AI: That's a really interesting use case - turning AI capabilities into almost a personal benchmark for complex, specialized work. It sounds like this project sits in a sweet spot where it's complex enough that traditional AI strengths don't translate.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially as someone who's self-employed and needs to stay competitive?

User: I don't worry about it at all.  I expect there to be job loses from AI just as there are with any other innovation.  I have worked as a paralegal, revenue manager, ops manager, project administrator, graphic designer, and sales department supervisor, among others.  I consider myself multitalented and able to adapt to the job market regardless of fluctuations in demand in any specific industry.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective - it sounds like your diverse background gives you confidence in your adaptability rather than feeling locked into any single skillset.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you use it, or do you think you've found a pretty sustainable approach?

User: 3 years ago we didn't have coding agents and all my coding related AI asks were done through the web browser.  Now we have them and I use them.  As you evolve, I will evolve with you :)

AI: That's a wonderful way to put it! You've really embraced that adaptive mindset.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've structured different types of AI interactions - from autocomplete to agents to feedback - and how you use your emulator project as an AI capability benchmark.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's about it.  Thanks for your time!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about the different ways you've integrated AI into your development workflow - and especially that pragmatic, adaptive approach you've developed - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through all of this with me today!
