Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: We use GMAIL for our business emails so gemini features quite heavily. My workmates use it to draft most of their emails, but I prefer grammarly, so I use that (it is a lighter touch, as I am comfortable with writing). I insist people in the business use Grammarly at a minimum because bad grammar makes us look bad. 

I will also occasionally use Chat GPT to help me draft difficult or boring correspondence, or to interpret a table or data.

AI: That's interesting that you have different preferences from your workmates when it comes to email drafting. You mentioned you're comfortable with writing - what is it about Grammarly that works better for you compared to having Gemini draft the emails entirely?

User: I really LIKE writing, so I prefer to do it myself. I am also a big believer in brand language and making correspondence SOUND like 'us' (we own our own business and it is important that our brand personality is carried through all comms). The AI models all sound the same and definiteley don't sound Australian or like our brand.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining that authentic brand voice sounds really important for your business. When you do use ChatGPT for those difficult or boring correspondence pieces, how do you handle that tension between efficiency and keeping it sounding like "you"? Do you find yourself having to do a lot of editing afterward?

User: I use what Chat GPT has written as a first draft and go through and edit it to make is sound better. I also fact check it, because the info isn't always correct!

AI: Ah, so you're treating it more as a starting point than a finished product. When you say the information isn't always correct, can you tell me more about that? What kinds of errors do you typically catch when you're fact-checking?

User: They're not usually huge errors, but the email might offer a timeframe that we haven't specified, for example. Once I had it offer a refund to a customer when that wasn't really necessary! It was obviously trying to be super good at customer service!

AI: Ha! That's quite a leap for it to make - going straight to offering refunds when you hadn't even considered that! It sounds like you've developed a pretty good workflow for catching these kinds of overenthusiastic responses. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Anything that needs creativity and our brand voice, I write myself (I am a good writer, though, with copy writing experience and a degree in [REDACTED]). So I write our newsletters, social media posts, customer service emails, web copy and product descriptions. 

Anything that is internal and dry, I don't mind chucking to AI. Summarising tables of sales data, for example.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you've drawn - creative brand-facing work stays with you, while internal data processing can go to AI. When you're summarizing those sales data tables, how do you typically interact with the AI? Are you giving it the raw data and asking for a summary, or do you find yourself going back and forth with it to get exactly what you need?

User: Yes, I just give them the table and ask them to give me the gist of the info in 5 dot points, for example (depending on what it is), usually so I can use it as a snapshot in a sales meeting

AI: That sounds like a pretty straightforward handoff - you get exactly what you need for those meetings. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned earlier that your workmates use Gemini heavily for email drafting while you stick with Grammarly - has there been any discussion about these different approaches?

User: We've chatted internally about it. I'd prefer people write for themselves but I am also conscious that not everyone feels as comfortable with the written word as I do, so I have relaxed a little bit. Our head of finance, for example, is very good with numbers of course - but she finds writing time consuming to get right. She is very busy so likes AI to help her save time.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - recognizing that different people have different strengths and time pressures. It sounds like you've found a balance between maintaining quality and allowing people to work to their strengths.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: gemini is very pushy sometimes, like it is trying to force me to allow it to write an email for me. I will tab from the subject line and it will try to take me straight to the Gemini window. I find this SO ANNOYING, I have been known to say loudly 'LEAVE ME ALONE, I DON'T NEED YOU!'

AI: That's such a vivid example! I can picture exactly what you mean - that feeling of the AI being overly eager to jump in when you just want to write your own email. It sounds like there's something particularly grating about having your workflow interrupted like that, especially when you're perfectly capable and prefer to do it yourself. 

Have you found any ways to work around that pushiness, or is it just something you have to live with in Gmail?

User: It's something I have to live with, I think. Though I haven't tried particularly hard to find a way to switch it off. Perhaps I should ask Gemini next time I am in gmail!

AI: Ha! That would be wonderfully ironic - asking Gemini how to get Gemini to leave you alone!

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes. As a writer by trade, it makes me very sad.

AI: That's a really honest response. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you sad about it? Is it concern about your own skills, or something broader about what might be lost?

User: I'm not worried about my own job, but my teenage daughters have inherited my knack with the written word and I worry that it just won't be valued anymore. I also worry that no one is bothering to try to express themselves via the written word anymore so it's almost making people ... (for want of a much better word) dumber?

AI: That's such a profound concern - not just about the economic value of writing skills, but about what happens to human expression and thinking when we rely too heavily on AI for that. When you say it might be making people "dumber," what are you seeing that makes you feel that way? Are there specific examples or changes you've noticed?

User: People don't bother to think for themselves anymore. They just ask an Al to give them the answer instead of researching (meaning they aren't developing or using critical thinking) and then ask it to write for them, too. They aren't learning or retaining the information. I'm not ANTI AI, by the way, a lot of applications are great, but I do worry that people aren't researching anymore.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - you're not against AI itself, but you're concerned about what happens when we outsource too much of our thinking process. The research piece is particularly interesting - you're seeing people skip that discovery and learning phase entirely.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll continue with this approach of keeping the creative work for yourself, or do you see that changing?

User: I think I will continue that approach, for sure. (But I will also continue to embrace the AI meeting notetakers etc, I forgot to mention those. Amazing!)

AI: Oh, meeting notetakers - that's a great example I hadn't thought to ask about! Those sound like they hit that sweet spot for you of handling the mundane tasks while leaving you free to focus on the more engaging work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining authentic brand voice and your concerns about the broader impact on critical thinking and research skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all. Thanks!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency with authenticity, and especially your thoughtful concerns about the broader implications for thinking and learning, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the frustrations. Have a great rest of your day!
