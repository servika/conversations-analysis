Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As an EMT, I don't really use AI in the field, but I do during patient care reports which I write after each call. I use it to help format stuff and to check medication types and treatments that I have to note down

AI: That's really interesting - using AI for the documentation side rather than direct patient care. 

Tell me more about how you use it for those patient care reports. What does that process look like for you?

User: Like I said, I use it for formatting, mostly to make sure my narrative (which is where I write what happened on the call and in what order) makes sense. I also use it to check different medications and treatments (so that I can accurately write what the patient was describing)

AI: I see - so it sounds like you're using it both to polish your writing and to verify medical information. 

When you say you use it to check medications and treatments that patients describe, can you walk me through what that looks like? How do you go about getting that information from the AI?

User: I would ask the AI something like "what does medication X do/treat for and how is it dosed" or "what is X treatment"

AI: That makes sense - getting those quick reference checks while you're documenting.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of your patient care reports that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I don't use AI to actually write my patient care reports, just to edit them or give me more information like I said earlier. They could probably write it if I put in the relevant information, but not only would I be worried about them missing things, there also is a sort of "style" in which a patient care report is written that AI can't really recreate easily.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction - you're drawing a clear line between using AI as a tool versus having it actually create the report itself.

When you mention there's a "style" to patient care reports that AI can't easily recreate, what does that look like? What makes that style unique or important in your field?

User: Largely it is based on the perspective you write the report in and how you word it. It isn't supposed to be completely smooth like an essay, you'd write it more like "Pt stated.... Pt also stated.... Pt's family on scene stated..." and there are many specific things that an AI would not know to include (like things that must be included for legal reasons). Especially if a patient refuses care, you have to make it very clear that they refused care after being informed of the risks up to and including death

AI: That's really illuminating - it sounds like there are both legal and professional standards that require very specific language and documentation patterns that you've learned through your training and experience.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with it throughout, but mostly the questions are self contained; like I said earlier, mostly its just for clarifying questions or checking stuff I have already written, not a back and forth.

AI: So it sounds like you're using AI more as a reference tool - asking discrete questions rather than having an ongoing conversation about your work.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other EMTs talk about using it, or is this something you've figured out on your own?

User: It's something I do on my own; a lot of my corps is older and don't use AI, and I don't know anyone else who uses AI a significant amount.

AI: That's interesting that you've developed this approach independently. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Since I use it to edit formatting sometimes, it has in the past made me feel unsatisfied by trying to change my formatting to have proper/smoother grammatical structure when I had a clear structure I was writing with (like I said above)

AI: That frustration makes total sense - the AI was trying to "help" by smoothing out your writing, but it was actually working against the specific professional format you needed to maintain.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think AI is far from taking over the field of emergency medicine. There are way too many unpredictable and physical aspects that would be hard to replace with AI or even robots.

AI: That's a good point about the physical and unpredictable nature of emergency medicine. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different tasks as the technology develops?

User: I feel like I could potentially see myself using it more if it manages to be able to match the style of my patient care reports, but this would be difficult without putting in more effort than its worth to "teach" it my style

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI works as a reference tool for you, but can't replicate the specialized professional style that's crucial for your documentation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a specialized reference tool while maintaining the critical professional standards of emergency medical documentation will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to understand how you've independently developed this approach and the clear boundaries you maintain between AI assistance and the core skills that define your profession. Thanks again!
