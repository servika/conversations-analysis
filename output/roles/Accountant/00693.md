Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yeah that sounds fine to me, no questions from me, fire away

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure, so I work as an accountant in my day to day job, so I try to use AI to help me with summarising reports or documents I receive, researching topics from the internet such as specific accounting standards I need to apply to my work, as well as asking for practical help such as how to use excel more effectively

AI: That's really helpful to understand. It sounds like you're using AI across quite a range of activities - from document work to research to practical skills.

When you mention summarizing reports or documents, what does that process typically look like for you? Do you feed the entire document to the AI, or do you approach it differently?

User: I will normally either feed the entire document and ask it to summarise or pick out important parts, or I myself will cherry-pick important parts of a document and maybe ask AI to help explain the overall concept or section in more detail to help me understand. I do always try to sense-check any AI summary, to ensure it is actually accurate

AI: That sense-checking step is interesting - it sounds like you've developed a pretty deliberate approach there.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think I am aware of the susceptibilities of AI models to hallucination or other methods by which they often come to the wrong conclusion. Whilst AI is a helpful tool, I think it still gets far too much wrong, and therefore cannot be blindly trusted. This is why I try to use it for more robotic, repetitive tasks that can be quickly/easily checked and verified for accuracy by myself. I think any more complex or judgemental areas of my work are likely to cause low-quality outputs from the AI and therefore be not as useful

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making between those more routine tasks versus the complex, judgmental work. 

When you use AI for those robotic, repetitive tasks that you can easily verify, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to delegate a complete task to the AI, and then judge myself how well I think the output is. As I have to do the same tasks each month during my job, I've almost built up over time a more step-by-step set of prompt instructions to allow marginal improvements to the quality of AI output each consecutive month as it helps me perform the same tasks over and over again. I guess both myself and the AI improve, as I learn how to provide more useful and precise prompts to the AI to get exactly what I need, and the AI in turn produces more and more accurate and correct/useful outputs for me

AI: That iterative refinement process sounds really interesting - building up those step-by-step prompts over time and seeing both sides get better at the interaction.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My workplace has encouraged us to use a specific AI companion, and hosted some training sessions etc on how to get the most out of it. I have not really discussed uses too much with my colleagues, as I think everyone is a little reluctant for AI to take over too much of their responsibilities. Accounting is often stereotyped as an industry ripe for AI to take over, so I think everyone is a bit wary on relying or using AI too much.

AI: That tension you're describing is really striking - the workplace encouraging AI use while people feel cautious about it potentially replacing their roles.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It has made me feel satisfied multiple times when I have asked for help in optimising my excel worksheets to perform specific tasks. For example, I often ask in words how I can do something in excel (such as pull the middle few characters from one cell into another) and it will often provide a formula that seems to get the job done. I've also given it some of my own excel formulae before and asked if they can be condensed or simplified but provide the same result, which the AI has also been able to help quite well with.

AI: That sounds like a really practical application where you're getting immediate value. The excel formula help seems to be working well for you.

Have there been times when using AI at work made you feel frustrated? What was happening in those situations?

User: I think sometimes I can feel frustrated with AI when I ask for help on how to do something, where perhaps the "standard" process isn't working. Even when mentioning this, it often gives a generic step-by-step how-to guide on how to perform the task, but where it assumes everything is working as expected. I don't think it is good at noticing there is a problem in me trying to perform a task and then adapting its response. Rather, it seems to recognise "oh, this person is trying to setup this account, let me give them the generic handbook guide".

AI: That's a really specific frustration - when you're dealing with something that's not working as expected, but the AI keeps giving you the standard playbook rather than helping you troubleshoot the actual problem you're facing.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think in my role specifically, AI will help me to efficiently and effortlessly complete the manual, robotic and rules-based elements of my job, but I will always be responsible for the judgemental pieces that require more complex thinking. Specifically as an accountant, for me I think this means ensuring I am up to date on the latest standards in terms of compliance and technical accounting, so I can focus on accurately performing these elements of my job, whilst AI maybe does the easier tasks such as generating a journal entry that I define to the AI model

AI: That division of labor makes a lot of sense - you focusing on the compliance and technical judgment while AI handles the more mechanical aspects like journal entries.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can definitely see AI becoming more and more important and integral to my job role. I think like computers in general, or microsoft excel, AI will quickly develop into one of those tools that workers are just expected to know how to use in order to enhance their productivity

AI: That's a really interesting analogy - AI becoming as fundamental as Excel or computers themselves in terms of expected workplace competency.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that iterative process of refining prompts month after month, and how you've developed that clear distinction between what you delegate versus what requires your judgment.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I do not think there's anything further from me, no. Happy to wrap up if you're done

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've developed that monthly refinement process, the balance between delegation and verification, and especially that perspective on AI becoming as fundamental as Excel - those will all be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Great, thanks!

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day!
