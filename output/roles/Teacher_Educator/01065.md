Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions, I am ready to begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I work in a public high school, teaching english as a second language. There are many ways in which I use AI mainly to help me create and check various documents for my lessons. Here are some of the tasks I have asked a Ai chat model to do for me:

AI: Tell me more about that document creation and checking process. What does that actually look like when you're preparing for your lessons?

User: It really depends on the class. The ai is never incharge of actually creating the documents but brainstorming ideas and coming up with examples. 

an actual example from my job. I was teaching about passive and active voice. I would get the ai to brainstorm example sentences for me for active and passive voice. I have found that ai is really good for all the grammatical aspects of my job. It saves me time being able to delegate this side of my work. 

I have also asked ai to help translate the materials from english into the native language of my students. Ai models have more room for cultural interpretation when it comes to translation unlike alternative apps like Google translate.   

I have asked ai to also provide culturally relevant examples, as I do not share a cultural background with my students. However I have found that ai typically struggles with this.

AI: That's fascinating how you've found AI works well for grammar examples but struggles with cultural relevance. When you say AI struggles with culturally relevant examples, what specifically have you noticed? What happens when you ask for that kind of help?

User: In my experience ai are very americanised. I was planning an activity to teach future tense in creating a bucket list "20 things I want to do before I turn 20". I was able to come up with 20 ideas myself but i wanted to provide more examples for the students. Although I teach in a high school and the students are 15-19 years old, their english language level is very low. Most students are not able to come up with original sentences. Therefore I wanted to provide a list of 50 ideas or so for them to chose their list from. I used an ai model, and explained the purpose of the task. I was clear about the city and country that I am teaching in, and requested a list of 50 ideas. I was clear in the instructions that the list should be things applicable to the nationality and cultural context of my students. The list was filled with suggestions that were very very American. At least 10 of the suggestions were about cars, getting my driving license, decorating my car, going through a drive through, decorating my senior parking space, going on a car road trip with my bestie etc. In the city I live and teach it is not common at all for people to own cars, and you need to be at least 18 years old to even a driving licence. Other suggestions were about homecoming or prom, which is once again very american and the concept does not exist in public schools in the country I teach in.

AI: That's a really clear example of the disconnect you're describing. When you got that very Americanized list back, what did you do next? Did you try to work with the AI to get better examples, or did you handle it differently?

User: I have found that it is really hard to get ai to understand culture. It is very clear if an ai has been trained on cultural data bases or not. I tried to rework the prompt a couple of times and ask for just more and more ideas. I think i was able to probably get 20 or so ideas from the ai to use, however they were generic teenager achievements like move out, get a gf/bf, get my first job, get into university etc. In order to get cultural context I had to actually ask my native friends of the country about their experiences and what kind of things I should include.

AI: So it sounds like you ended up needing to combine AI-generated ideas with input from your local friends to get what you really needed. When you think about that experience versus using AI for grammar examples, how do those two different types of tasks feel to use AI for?

User: I think grammar tasks are within the ai scope of abilities, and they feel so streamline and easy. I do not have to be overly specific about my prompts and 98/100 times I will get high quality responses, that require no editing. It really feels like the ai is an amazing tool of the future when this happens because it saves me like 20m-60m or work, depending on the complexity of the grammar point. The examples can be highly customisable and you can even ask for whole stories to be written within seconds.

AI: That contrast is really striking - the smooth experience with grammar versus the struggle with cultural context. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think i have realised through continued usage that anything cultural is easier to be done alone or through the help of my friends from the culture. I found that ai struggle to understand what is appropriate for teenagers and what is considered cool. For example creating trivia quizes - ai can never seem to find the right balance for difficulty. As i mentioned the kids have low level english, but not low intelligence.  questions need to be challenging but using simple english. the topics also need to be engaging for teenagers. I always try ai for when I am coming up with my quizes - which I usually have to create once a week. But I have never actually felt satisfied with the options I was given.

AI: That balance you describe - challenging but with simple English, engaging for teenagers - sounds like it requires a lot of nuanced understanding. When you do create those quizzes yourself or with help from local friends, what are you drawing on that the AI seems to miss?

User: Quizes need a sense of competition - so they need to be challenging so not every student would know, but they also need to be diverse in their topics. For example, a lot of my students really like disney. When i ask ai to create questions, they become too complicated asking about like a specific old movie that the kids probably haven't watched. If i correct the model, it then tends to go into the other extreme and become too easy. For example it would ask about the names of the gargoyles in the hunck back of notre dame, as the hard question. But that is too niche, the students are simple fans of disney, not super disney fans. So then easy question would then be like "what is the name of the iconic Disney Mouse character?" which is too easy, and not really in line with the spirit of a quiz. I would instead ask "how many fingers does Micky have?" - the question is simple, using simple vocabulary, but not everyone knows. Students guess 5 or 3 frequently, but also about half know the real answer of 4.

AI: That Mickey Mouse fingers example perfectly illustrates what you mean - it's that sweet spot of being accessible but not obvious. It sounds like you've developed a real sense for what works with your specific students. When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Well it depends on what you mean with delegation. Because I usually make my templates on canva or other similar platforms. When I ask for examples, that is just one part of the lesson, and the rest is done by me without any assistance.

AI: That's a helpful clarification. So when you're working on that one piece - like getting grammar examples - are you typically going back and forth with the AI to refine what you need, or do you usually get what you want in one or two tries and move on?

User: I think usually the one or two tries for grammar tasks is enough. I use the examples as good jumping off points and can remix as needed. for cultural tasks, really depends on how much I can actually get from the ai. Some days it really misses the mark, and I find it much quicker to just scout sites like twitter or reddit to get what teenagers are talking about

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Only a little, I think in the country I teach, the culture is more about being independant and being able to complete things on your own. When I was working in the UK, the culture was more helpful , so instead of Ai, I would ask my coworkers. Now, I ask ai first.

AI: That's interesting - so AI has become a substitute for that collaborative culture you experienced in the UK. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Nothing that is overly terrible. However, I really hate when the suggestions ai makes are very clearly for tourists. So like when asking for trivia questions about the country, the suggestions are so basic like what is the capital of the country, what is the currency called, what is a popular dish from the country etc. Like you do not ask natives these kinds of questions about their own country in a quiz. Every Single national would be able to answer these.

AI: That tourist-level knowledge must be especially frustrating when you're trying to create something for students who live there. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Considering my background is in cultural research, and my current position is teaching, I am not worried about ai taking over for a while. As demonstrated by my examples of the limitations of ai usage.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Hopefully as Ai evolves, there would be opportunity to create more indepth and customisable worksheets. It would be amazing if each student could receive their own personalised worjsheets to their interests.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI works well for technical tasks like grammar but struggles with the cultural nuance that's so important for engaging your students.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the contrast between AI's strengths in grammar and its limitations with cultural context will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
