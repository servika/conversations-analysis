Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it primarily for research and for writing. For instance, it helped me recently draft new bylaws and procedures for our program

AI: That's interesting - drafting bylaws and procedures sounds like pretty important work. 

Tell me more about that process. How did you work with AI on something as formal as bylaws?

User: I gave the information I really wanted to make sure I included. Hit the high points. Laid out general structure. Explained that I needed to draft formal bylaws and procedures. The AI has become fairly familiar with the issues that needed to be addressed through all our previous conversations about the program and was able to ensure each of those topics was included in the policies. It also helped to lay it all out in a typical bylaw format

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you've built up a working relationship with AI over multiple conversations about your program. 

When you say the AI became "fairly familiar with the issues," can you walk me through how that knowledge developed? Was this something that happened gradually through your discussions, or did you have to re-explain context each time?

User: I've actually been pleasantly surprised that I don't typically have to re-explain context. Usually, it knows exactly what I'm talking about based on previous conversations. For instance, I needed help drafting a portion of the bylaws that would address a registration policy. I had previously looked into legality on the current policy and what changes I could make. It caught that I was referring to the same policy I had mentioned previously and drafted a perfect policy to address my previous concerns.

AI: That continuity sounds really valuable for complex work like policy development. 

I'm curious about the balance of control in that process - when you were working on those bylaws, were you more collaborating back and forth with the AI throughout the drafting, or did you give it your requirements and let it handle the complete drafting independently?

User: I would say it was collaborative. I gave basics. It fleshed it out, reworded and reformatted. I asked it to add this or that, or make a correction here or there and the draft took shape that way

AI: That collaborative approach sounds quite fluid. 

Are there certain tasks in your work - whether it's research, writing, or other areas - where you prefer to handle things yourself even though AI could potentially help? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I don't typically give canned AI responses to correspondence. I probably could for some that aren't as serious, but I like to keep it personal and ensure that I'm authentic. That said, I have, on occasion, asked AI to check tone on a response or reword to take on a specific tone.

AI: That distinction around authenticity in correspondence makes a lot of sense. 

When you do ask AI to check tone or help with rewording, what prompts you to seek that assistance? Are there specific situations or types of communications where you find that particularly helpful?

User: If it's a message that has potential to spark conflict, I may ask it to reword it in a positive, encouraging way. Or I may ask it to reword it to sound more professional. Sometimes I outright explain the situation to the model and then ask it to make it sound more appropriate to the situation

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as a kind of communication advisor when stakes are higher.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself being open about using it, or is it something you approach more cautiously?

User: It's not typically discussed. There's an understood that it's utilized, though each person determines to what degree.

AI: That's an interesting dynamic - an unspoken understanding without explicit policies or discussions.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Of course, there are sometimes that AI is just off. For instance, I was working on a piece about our building (which is a historic building in town) and asked what year it was opened. I would have understood if it simply couldn't find the information, but it told me the building didn't exist and I must be confused and gave me another building that I'd never heard of.

AI: That must have been frustrating - especially when you know the building well! It sounds like the AI was confidently wrong rather than just saying it didn't know.

On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI left you feeling particularly satisfied with the outcome?

User: I've been very satisfied with its work on this process of drafting the bylaws. It's been exceptional. Very intuitive. The wording and format are extremely professional and it asks great questions to make sure I'm remembering everything I might need to include

AI: It sounds like the AI really understood both the technical requirements and the broader context of what you were trying to accomplish with those bylaws.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not really worried about it for me. I do a lot of face-to-face work and interpersonal skills aren't going anywhere. However, there's definitely concern for my kids. Honestly, I think my biggest concern is that many people are using AI to accomplish things rather than learning and frankly, they're getting dumber.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - recognizing where your interpersonal skills create value while having broader concerns about learning and development.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different types of tasks?

User: I have seen shifts in the way I've used it, especially in the past year. I'm becoming more aware of the possibilities and capabilities. So I think there's definitely room for me to incorporate more.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborative partner for complex policy work while maintaining authenticity in personal communications.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's all. Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of working with AI, especially on complex tasks like bylaws, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining authenticity in communications will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
