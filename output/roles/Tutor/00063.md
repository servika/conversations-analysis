Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today - I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I have researched a lot about MLB pitcher arm injuries. I did my honors thesis on this topic. I used a ton of data from the official MLB website to find who was injured, as well as their specific injury. My initial hypothesis was that the increase in pitcher arm injuries was due to the implementation of the pitch clock. I found that this was not true, as I ended up researching velocity and spin rates of pitchers who were injured. I used AI tools to help create graphs and analyze data.

AI: That's a fascinating research topic - the pitch clock hypothesis is really interesting even though it didn't pan out as expected. It sounds like velocity and spin rates turned out to be more significant factors than you initially thought.

You mentioned using AI tools to help create graphs and analyze data. Can you tell me more about that - what specific tasks did you use AI for in that part of your research?

User: My research used a ton of data. I needed to find a way to condense this, so I asked AI the best ways to form graphs for my specific data. I was really lost on my own and overwhelmed with the plethora of information I had gathered.

AI: That sounds like exactly the kind of situation where having some guidance would be really valuable - being overwhelmed by a large dataset is such a common challenge in research.

When you were deciding whether to ask AI for help with organizing that data versus maybe asking a professor, colleague, or trying to figure it out on your own, what made you choose the AI route?

User: AI was the most readily available option. I was a student-athlete during my undergraduate studies, so time was very limited. I was playing Division 1 softball, while also being a tutor at my school. I was really pressed for time while creating my thesis. I tried to create graphs on my own, but they did not make much sense, so I decided I needed some form of help. I was working late nights on my thesis, as I had games or practice during the day after my classes. Since this was an independent study, I didn't have much time to work one-on-one with my advisor.

AI: That really paints a clear picture of how practical constraints shaped your decision - the 24/7 availability of AI versus trying to coordinate schedules with your advisor while juggling athletics and tutoring makes complete sense.

When you did get help from AI on creating those graphs, how did you go about verifying or making sure that the visualizations it suggested actually made sense for your specific research questions about pitcher injuries?

User: I made sure to critically analyze the graphs myself, since AI isn't always accurate. I found that the graphs were perfect for my analysis. I did end up showing my advisor the graphs eventually, and he was very happy with the results. I did make sure to put specific ideas that I wanted in the graphs. This included graphs about pitch velocity versus spin rate and graphs of total arm injuries/types of arm injuries.

AI: That's great that you had that critical evaluation process in place, and it sounds like your advisor's positive feedback validated your approach. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like the initial literature review, data collection from the MLB website, or writing up your findings - were there areas where you didn't use AI? And if so, what kept you from trying it in those parts?

User: I did not use AI in my literature review. I found a lot of resources that could have helped me, but I actually ended up using most of the data I found. A lot of my research was solely my own, so I didn't use a ton of other literature. If needed, I could have used AI to summarize the main points of the literature, but this wasn't completely necessary with my thesis research. For data collection, I also did this by myself. I found a website that showed everything about who was injured and how. It was an overwhelming amount of information that I had to sort through alone. I really wish I could have used AI to find the information I needed. I did not use AI because honestly, I didn't know how to. It probably would have decreased a ton of time I did researching if I could have properly used it.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there was a real knowledge gap about how to leverage AI for data collection and sorting, even when you could see it would have been valuable. The time you spent manually sorting through all that injury information sounds incredibly time-consuming.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - whether that's the data collection piece you mentioned or something else entirely - what would that be and why?

User: Definitely the data collection piece. This is by far the most time consuming part of research, especially when there is a lot of data to sort through. I wish I could use AI to find all the pitchers who had an arm injury and put them in a data sheet by itself. The website I used contained information about all players and all injuries. If this data was condensed to just pitcher arm injuries, it would have been a lot easier to gather.

AI: That makes perfect sense - having AI automatically filter and organize that massive dataset down to just the relevant pitcher arm injury cases would have been a huge time-saver. It sounds like that kind of data preprocessing and filtering is where you see the biggest potential impact.

Those are all my questions, and your perspectives on how practical constraints like time and availability shaped your AI usage decisions were particularly insightful. You've given me a really clear picture of both where AI helped you succeed and where knowledge gaps prevented you from using it where it could have been most valuable.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Nothing else!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the tension between needing help with data management but not knowing how to effectively use AI for that purpose really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The contrast between your successful use of AI for data visualization versus the missed opportunity for data collection preprocessing was especially illuminating.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
