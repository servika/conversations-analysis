Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for mundane tasks. I also use it for tracking meeting notes and tasks that myself and others on the call are to do before the next call.

AI: That's helpful to know. When you mention mundane tasks, what specific examples come to mind? What does that look like in practice for you?

User: Doing basic math sometimes, other times it's asking how to format something in a document or a formula in an excel file.

AI: I see, so you're using it for quick calculations and formatting help. When it comes to your meeting notes and task tracking, can you walk me through how that process works? How do you typically capture and organize that information with AI?

User: If you are using a microsoft teams account, you can register with certain websites that will invite AI to the meeting and track what's discussed. It will then use that information to outline certain people's tasks on the call and tell them what they need to do.

AI: That's interesting - so the AI is actually joining your meetings and automatically identifying action items for different people. How has that changed the way your meetings run, or how people behave during them?

User: Sometimes, people are less involved because they know they can rely on the AI to give them the meeting notes at the end. The most extreme example is not joining the call at all. It does not change how I run my meetings, but I do review the overview at the end to ensure those notes are accurate, especially if people rely on them.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about people becoming less engaged or even skipping meetings entirely. When you're reviewing those AI-generated notes for accuracy, what kinds of things do you typically find that need correction? What does the AI tend to miss or get wrong?

User: Leaving tasks unassigned when they were assigned, and creating tasks for things that were just notes in the call. Lastly, the AI could miss delegating things to people as well.

AI: So it sounds like the AI struggles with the nuance of distinguishing between casual discussion versus actual task assignments, and correctly identifying who's responsible for what. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Some tasks are delegating to the client and not me, and those would be nice as a reminder to the client for the AI to handle. On tasks for myself, or internal tasks my team needs to do, I don't need the reminder. It creates too many follow up notes.

AI: That makes sense - you want the AI handling client-facing reminders but not cluttering your internal workflow with unnecessary follow-ups. 

When you do use AI for work tasks like those calculations or Excel formulas, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to ask for what you need and then take it from there?

User: I tend to ask what I need and then take it from there. For example, if I have a certain project I'm working on and need to know to use a SUMIF formula or a different formula, it helps make that decision and I can take it from there. Some projects would take longer to explain everything to AI, sometimes it is easier to just get the answer and do it myself.

AI: That's a practical approach - getting the specific piece you need rather than trying to hand off the whole project. It sounds like you're weighing the time it would take to explain context versus just doing the work yourself.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not much, it is still in the early stages. Most of the use of AI is just having it join our calls. As that changes, I do think my company (being a software company) will get involved and maybe even enlist it's uses in our software as well.

AI: So you're still in that early exploration phase as a company. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Only satisfied. It does not revolutionize anything yet, but I could see it quickly becoming something that could expedite whole parts of our jobs.

AI: That's an optimistic view. When you think about AI potentially expediting whole parts of your job in the future, how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes. I actively train on new things being changed in our software, and making sure I can operate without any AI help if needed.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - staying sharp on the fundamentals while exploring AI's benefits. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I believe it will be placed in our software to expedite support tickets, additional training, defining menus, etc. It could help with the follow up emails clients send us on retraining people or training new hires.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how meeting attendance has changed with AI note-taking, and your balanced approach to staying skilled while embracing AI's efficiency benefits.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. Have a great rest of your day!
