Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I'm ready.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I run a record label called [REDACTED] and a music production company. I use AI (specifically ChatGPT) to help with developing marketing plans for my music releases. I also use it for research to find artists to collaborate with. But I mostly use it for marketing ideation.

AI: That's fascinating - a record label and production company sounds like a creative and dynamic environment. 

When you say you use it for marketing ideation, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? What specific parts of developing those marketing plans does AI help you with?

User: Sure. For instance for my recent 'loops' album. I used AI to help me find solutions for ordering cassette players in bulk. I used cassette players as part of the marketing (a retro idea). I also used AI to help me develop an album rollout and marketing timeline that included PR/outreach, playlisting, and social media.

AI: That's really creative - using cassette players as a marketing hook for a loops album. 

Tell me more about how you approached the AI for that album rollout and timeline. Did you give it specific constraints or information about your budget, audience, or goals, or did you start more broadly and then refine from there?

User: Yes, I gave it my marketing budget, my audience (lo-fi instrumental hip-hop lovers), and my release dates for the singles and album.

AI: That sounds like a pretty detailed brief you provided. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in running your label and production company that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to have a human design album covers. I don't see myself using AI for artwork. So I mostly use AI for marketing ideation.

AI: That's an interesting distinction you make about artwork. 

What is it about album cover design that makes you want to keep that with human designers? What's different about that creative process compared to the marketing ideation where you're comfortable using AI?

User: I love the human feel of human-created artwork and I don't think AI can replicate the human intricacies in art. With marketing ideation, I can take the AI's advice, leave it, or adjust it to make it my own.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's something different about having that flexibility to adapt the marketing ideas versus the artwork needing to capture that human essence.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Collaborate for sure.

AI: Can you give me an example of what that collaboration looks like in practice? Maybe walk me through how you and the AI worked together on one of those marketing tasks - like the cassette player idea or the rollout timeline?

User: I would give the AI a basic idea of my goals like the number of cassette players I'd like to order and autograph and my deadline for when I need the players. AI recommended Alibaba and I took it from there.

AI: That's a great example of that collaborative approach - AI pointing you toward Alibaba and then you taking it from there.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or since you run your own label, how do the artists you work with or others in the music industry view your use of AI?

User: Well, I'm a one man army at the record label and the artists I work with don't really get into the marketing side of things so they don't know that collaborate with AI to help develop marketing strategies. They just see the results.

AI: That's an interesting dynamic - being the sole decision-maker on the business side while the artists focus on their creative work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was satisfied with the rollout plan for my 'loops' album for sure. The roll out was realistic and it worked out great. As I mentioned earlier, I've gotten frustrated in the past when trying to use AI to help me design cover art. I just couldn't find any artwork that satisfied me.

AI: That contrast is really telling - the satisfaction with the realistic rollout plan that actually worked versus the frustration with artwork that just didn't meet your standards.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider when deciding what to use AI for versus what to handle yourself?

User: Oh for sure, I know AI is making music these days. I just try to remain creative and hone my own sound. My sound is my brand and I'm confident that my listeners will recognize my art when they hear it.

AI: That confidence in your unique sound and brand really comes through. It sounds like you've found a balance between leveraging AI where it makes sense and protecting what's distinctly yours.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or keeping it pretty much in the same role it plays now?

User: I can see myself experimenting with delegating and automating AI tasks in the future...especially marketing tasks.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your clear distinction between where you value human creativity - like in your music and artwork - versus where you see AI as a useful collaborator for practical tasks like marketing strategy.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope. I think we covered it all.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that balance between leveraging AI for business efficiency while preserving the human elements that define your artistic brand will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really interesting to hear how you've carved out such a clear philosophy around where AI fits - and doesn't fit - in your creative business. Best of luck with your future releases!
