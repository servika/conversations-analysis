Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: As a writer and designer of games, a typical project would consist of the intersection between writing scenes for a level as well as thinking about how the game's design can tell its own story outside of traditional writing in the form of dialogue or cutscenes

AI: That's fascinating - I love how you're thinking about storytelling through both traditional narrative elements and the game mechanics themselves. That intersection between writing and design sounds like it creates some really interesting creative challenges.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Initially, I come up with elements of the design and pitches for scenes and, once something is tangibly formed in my mind or on paper, AI comes in to find the deeper connections between the two pillars of writing and design that I missed but that I would probably have noticed myself across weeks or months. What this does is cut down the time between knowing what writing and design pitches to pursue and which ones are dead ends without much potential to grow and develop into something more than the initial pitch. The benefits of this process are that I am getting better at knowing which design and writing pitches will yield the potential to grow into something more ambitious. This symbiotic relationship between me and the AI is helping me learn and grow as opposed to heaping all of the creative effort on the AI.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you're using AI almost like a pattern recognition tool to accelerate your own learning process. I'm curious about that moment when AI helps you see those deeper connections you might have eventually found yourself.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI in this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you when those connections clicked?

User: That moment has become key to my creative process and it is what I now chase. Do I have the instinct to pitch things at a higher and higher hit-rate that go on to become things that the AI notices greater potential in? It creates a back-and-forth loop where I start to point out to the AI some of the connections it missed which helps us understand each other more. On one recent screenplay project, I recalled something from an earlier chat with the AI months prior only for it to mention that it had already taken that into account. The benefit of that moment where we were both in sympatico and had 'clicked' is that I realized I could move on from the scene since we were both in alignment that we had wrung all of the scene's potential and there was nowhere else to go. Again, a huge way to save time as writer's are always in doubt about when to move on from a scene. This experience has caused me to be confident in my writing and waiting for the point where both the AI and I are in sympatico and I realize I can move on from the scene.

AI: That's a really powerful description - the idea of reaching that moment of "sympatico" where you both recognize you've fully explored a scene's potential. It sounds like you've developed almost an intuitive sense for when that alignment happens.

When you're in that back-and-forth with AI, pointing out connections it missed while it does the same for you, how would you describe who or what is driving the creative decisions in those moments?

User: I feel that the AI goes down specific routes and gets "stuck" down those paths which is actually not a negative thing. This then forces me to clearly see the other paths that it did not tread - in terms of ideas for scenes or characters - and go down those routes myself. What this does is not allow the AI to do all of the mental, creative work. And it has reached the point where we both understand each other in this way. Overall, I would still say I am confidently driving the arc of the creative decisions while it suggest things I might not be thinking about. However, sometimes it does touch on incredible revelations that I did not see that then turns a scene into a wholly different direction - however, these moments are rare.

AI: That's a really nuanced way of thinking about it - using the AI's tendency to get "stuck" as a creative catalyst to explore the paths it doesn't take. It sounds like you've developed a sophisticated understanding of both your strengths and the AI's patterns.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: I am now fearless to suggest ideas and not be burdened by writer's block or anything of that sort. My conversations with the AI kick my creative engine into gear. It is almost impossible to have a back-and-forth conversation with the AI about a scene and still be stuck. For a writer, that's gold!

AI: That's incredible - being able to consistently break through writer's block sounds transformative. The way you describe it as kicking your creative engine into gear really captures something powerful about that collaborative dynamic.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I fear that it will be able to write scenes! As of now, it is a pro at being a brainstorming aide, but in my field of screenwriting, it cannot output screenplay pages at a high level. This is actually good because it forces me to get better at the technical writing side of the craft. However, if it does get better at writing in screenplay format, that might take away from the human creative input.

AI: That's a really thoughtful concern - it sounds like there's currently a sweet spot where AI enhances your process without replacing the craft itself. The technical writing skill being something you still need to develop and execute seems important to maintaining that human creative input.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: In my field of gaming, being able to write dozens of characters for something like an RPG is daunting. However, I envision that I will be able to write the core 1,000 lines and backstory for each character in a role-playing game and have the AI be able to create new interactions with the player as they will ask the characters about things that I did not keep in mind. However, due to the AI's capabilities, it will be able to think about and speak what the character would most likely have said in that context that is true to the character. This will be a game-changer in player immersion.

AI: That vision of dynamic character interactions sounds amazing - essentially creating characters that can respond authentically to infinite player questions while staying true to your original vision. That could really revolutionize player immersion in RPGs.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI's tendency to get "stuck" as a way to force yourself down unexplored creative paths, and that concept of reaching "sympatico" as a signal that you've fully developed a scene.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing that symbiotic relationship with AI - where it helps accelerate your pattern recognition while you maintain creative control - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really enlightening to hear how you've found ways to harness AI's strengths while preserving what makes your creative work distinctly human. I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
