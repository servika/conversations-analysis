Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, let's begin.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI the most when planning a lesson. So, for example, if I want to teach a Design and Technology topic, like anthropometrics, I will ask how to teach this in an exciting way. I will also ask it to use Bloom's Taxonomy when coming up with differentiated learning objectives. I would ask AI to come up with research methods students can use, starters, mains, plenaries, how to teach students to use iterative designing, how to effectively develop designs, refining final designs and prototypes and testing and evaluating. As well as this, I get ideas for homework and how to create marking sheets, particularly for GCSE and A Level students. I also ask AI to come up with seating plans, so I may give the Model student information regarding predicted or previous grades, behaviour and current performance.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across so many different aspects of lesson planning. It sounds like you're getting quite comprehensive support, from the pedagogical structure with Bloom's Taxonomy all the way through to practical classroom management with seating plans.

Tell me more about that process when you're planning a lesson on something like anthropometrics. How do you typically work through that with AI?

User: I would first share which year group and level I am teaching this topic with, so whether it is for a high ability group or a remedial class. A starter activity about anthropometrics would first be on my list, so I would ask the Model to come up with an activity which is based on real life, so the students can relate to it, and ensure it touched upon the topic anthropometrics. If the result is too broad, I would ask it to simplify, and I would also give a time of how long it should take for the starter to be completed. Then I would ask the Model to come up with learning objectives, all based on differentiation and ask it to incorporate grades to each objective. For example, grade A-B, C-B etc. I would ask for VAK ideas throughout my lesson, so ask the Model to find appropriate videos, sounds, and hands on activities. The lesson would need to be split up. So, starters could take 10 minutes, main activity should take 40 and the plenary should take another 10. I would ask the Model to come up with material for those who finish tasks confidently and extra help for those struggling. I would also ask it how to check for understanding during the lesson, so I know, as a teacher, what to improve on while I'm teaching the lesson.

AI: That's a really detailed workflow you've developed. I'm struck by how iterative your process seems to be - you start with a broad request and then refine it based on what the AI gives you back.

When you say you ask it to simplify if the result is too broad, what does that back-and-forth look like? Can you walk me through a specific example of how you might refine the AI's response?

User: So, the AI might come up with an "evaluating a product activity" which involves taking a product, like a chair, and seeing how it fits the human body. I would then ask it to come up with other products so each group has a different product to work on, something more interesting than just a "chair" or "keyboard", perhaps something like a PlayStation controller. This way when the students feedback to the class, it is not repetitive. I would also ask it to come up with way how to measure products to tailor it to fit a tall or short person, instead of the basic measuring tape, why not a piece of string to make it more challenging? Or even measure blindfolded, just to make the activity more exciting. I always try to ask the AI to come up with unique ideas that are simple but inventive.

AI: I love how you're pushing the AI to get more creative and engaging - moving from a basic chair to a PlayStation controller, or using string instead of a measuring tape. It sounds like you have a clear vision of what makes a lesson exciting for students.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: As I teach design and technology, this involves mathematics and engineering. For technical questions, such as problem solving and geometry, I prefer to learn this myself, rather than asking the Model. Maths isn't my strongest point and I prefer to fully understand how to tackle a problem, rather than taking a shortcut to ask AI. When I do need something explaining, I consult maths teachers, and prefer the explanation to come from the teachers of the school I work at, as students are taught in a particular way in their own maths lessons and I want to keep that consistent with my way of teaching. This way the students don't get confused, as an AI model may come up with several different ways a problem is solved, rather than what's taught in my school's curriculum.

AI: That's really thoughtful - you're prioritizing consistency for your students and your own deep understanding over convenience. It sounds like you see real value in maintaining that human connection, especially when it comes to ensuring students aren't getting conflicting approaches.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I rarely delegate tasks for AI to complete independently. I always provide examples of what I've already done, ask it for feedback, like what could be done better, and then ask it for examples. I might provide a starter idea for a new cohort, and I might ask whether it quits the level of the students, what I could change, and then ask it to give me examples of how it would tackle the activity. I would use my findings and the Model's findings to come up with something even better.

AI: So it really is a collaborative process for you - you're bringing your existing work and experience to the conversation, and then building something better together. That's interesting that you almost never just hand something off completely.

Can you give me a specific example of a time when you brought something you'd already created to AI for feedback? What was that exchange like and how did it help you improve what you had?

User: Workshop safety rules for example. So, I would tell the AI that I have an activity where I pick a type of machinery in the workshop and ask students to come up with workshop safety rules. So, I might give an example of a rule - "Always wear safety glasses". Then, I would ask the Model to come up with something a bit more interesting and develop this rule. It was simple, and needed work, as it was not specific enough for using a lathe for example. It would then state why wearing safety glasses is important and how the glasses protect wood chips and dust from entering the eyes. It might come up with something long, too long for a rule, so then I might ask it to simplify it for my remedial class, or classes where there are many students who have English as an additional language. I might even say, create an activity from it, and it would come up with a fill in the gaps exercise. But then, I might ask it to come up with the answers for a lower ability group, where they can select the words and put them into the gaps, whereas the higher ability students won't have access to those words and would have to use their correct knowledge to fill in the gaps. All students would be busy and enjoying their work this way.

AI: That's a great example of how you iterate together - starting with your basic rule, getting it expanded and made more specific, then adapted for different ability levels, and finally turned into an engaging activity format. You're really using AI as a thinking partner to develop ideas in multiple directions.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: So we are staff members ranging from ages 22-60+. The older generation are used to traditional methods of teaching, a lot of book work and listening. It has been a while since they had their teacher training. When looking at their lessons, I may have trouble understanding their methods. So this is where Ai is helpful for me, it allows me to understand other people's teaching methods and how I can apply their ideas to my own work, but in a modern and more appropriate way.

AI: That's fascinating - so AI is actually helping you bridge a generational gap in teaching approaches. You're using it to translate or modernize more traditional methods from your older colleagues.

Can you tell me more about what that translation process looks like? When you take one of their traditional approaches to AI, what kinds of questions do you ask to help modernize it?

User: I might ask it to improve a slide from a presentation. It might be text heavy and seem like it's copied from an academic paper. I'll ask it to make it appropriate for Generation alpha students, use less text, maybe some TikTok videos is appropriate.

AI: That's really interesting - you're specifically thinking about Generation Alpha and using platforms like TikTok to connect with them. It sounds like you're very conscious of meeting students where they are.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustrated - when I have used AI and a student asks me for clarification, but I'm struggling to understand it myself as it's too technical. 

Satisfied - when it came up with exciting material for my lesson. Ofsted visiting that day and stating that it was an exceptional lesson.

AI: That contrast is really telling - the frustration when you can't properly explain something AI helped with because you didn't fully understand it yourself, versus the satisfaction when it genuinely enhanced your teaching effectiveness.

Tell me more about that Ofsted visit. What specifically had AI helped you create for that lesson that made it so successful?

User: A soldering lesson. How to solder perfectly. It came up with video examples, a song about soldering, students performing actions of soldering, watching my demonstration and allowing students to have a go in front of their friends, rating their work, having a bit of fun but still learning.

AI: That sounds like it was a really engaging, multi-sensory lesson - combining demonstration, performance, peer feedback, and even music! It's clear why that would stand out to an inspector.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: In practical work, I suppose AI would currently struggle to teach students how to hold a tenon saw or make a dove joint out of jelutong. So, I wouldn't want that to happen, as I feel that this is my expertise. But I wouldn't mind it helping me to be better and more confident.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're drawing a clear line between your hands-on craft expertise that students need to learn from you directly, versus using AI to enhance your confidence and effectiveness as a teacher.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see myself using it more and more, however, I still try to be natural when teaching. I would prefer if students did not use AI as this could hinder their creativity. Perhaps AI could help me to understand how to become a great head teacher. Perhaps we could have some official training on AI, and I would love to be in charge of that and go on some courses, as there are staff who do not like the idea of AI at all.

AI: That's really interesting - you see a future where you use AI more but want to protect your students' creativity from it. And it sounds like you're already thinking about becoming a leader in AI adoption at your school.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborative thinking partner while maintaining clear boundaries around your craft expertise and student creativity.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner in lesson planning, bridging generational teaching approaches, and maintaining the balance between AI assistance and preserving hands-on expertise will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to understand how thoughtfully you approach this technology - both embracing its potential while being mindful of its limitations. Best of luck with your teaching and any future leadership roles in AI training at your school!
