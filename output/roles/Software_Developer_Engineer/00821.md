Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I try not to use AI for tasks where I don't need it.  I find it's useful for brainstorming ideas for abstract problems, or for asking SQL questions when writing complex queries

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned you try not to use AI for tasks where you don't need it. Can you tell me more about how you decide whether you need it or not for a particular task?

User: Generally I won't use it for text generation. I see too many people doing that, and I find you lose your own voice if you are just generating AI text.  Everyone's writing begins to look the same

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective. When you do use it for brainstorming on abstract problems - can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How do you typically interact with AI during that brainstorming process?

User: I will typically use it as a starting point, as I find it can 'think outside the box' due to not having the bias of context that I would otherwise have.  So I might ask, what are some lead measures that would be reliable indicators for this KPI that we want to improve in xyz scenario, these are some of the measurements we use today and why they aren't reliable.  I actually find the more general I keep it, the better.  With too many specifics, the model tends to go into solutioning mode and tends to actually offer less variety

AI: That's a fascinating insight about keeping things general to avoid the model going into "solutioning mode." When you get those initial brainstorming ideas back, what do you typically do with them? Do you continue working with the AI to develop the ideas further, or do you take those starting points and work on them independently?

User: I might ask the AI to flesh out an idea that I find interesting, like an example of how something would be calculated or a step by step implementation plan.  I'll almost never copy this verbatim but it helps to have a framework to start from rather than working from a blank page.

AI: So it sounds like you're using AI more as a collaborative thinking partner rather than delegating complete tasks to it. I'm curious - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: As I said I could use AI to generate text, emails, or SQL queries, but I try not to.  I see far too many people doing that and you can tell that when they get into challenging conversations, they lack the linguistic skills because they're too used to leaning on AI to do writing for them.

AI: That concern about maintaining your own skills is really compelling. When you mentioned SQL queries specifically - you said AI is useful for asking SQL questions, but you also try not to use it for generating queries. Can you help me understand that distinction?

User: Similar to coding, if I'm stuck on a syntax issue I might go to AI to get unstuck.  So I might ask a question like, how do I structure a Begin-End loop or update data in a temp table.  But I won't then copy paste sections of code

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it more as a reference guide rather than a code generator. I'm curious about how your workplace or colleagues have influenced the way you approach AI. Do you see different usage patterns around you, and has that shaped your own approach?

User: Yes, it's my coworkers that I see using AI the most and it's turned me completely off of ever using it for writing.  They all have the same telltale AI signs like over-formatted responses, bolding in the middle of text to make a point (which most people almost never do) to the point where its painfully obvious.  I don't think they realize they are writing themselves out of a job by showing an AI can essentially do most of what their job is

AI: That's a striking observation about people potentially writing themselves out of their jobs. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI summarization of meeting notes is particularly frustrating.  I have read summaries where it summarized what I said in a meeting completely incorrectly or misunderstood context.

AI: That sounds really frustrating, especially when it's misrepresenting what you actually said. On the flip side, have there been times when using AI felt particularly satisfying or helpful to you?

User: It saves a lot of time solving coding or SQL syntax issues.  I can typically get an answer much faster than scrolling through dozens of forums and reddit posts

AI: That's a great practical benefit. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself maintaining this current approach, or do you think it might change over time?

User: I could see my approach changing as tools improve, like if summarization becomes reliably accurate, it could save time reading long documents.  I don't think I will ever use it for personal writing though

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've observed AI changing your colleagues' writing styles and your intentional approach to maintaining your own voice and skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I think that covers it

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining personal skills while selectively using AI as a thinking partner, and your observations about workplace AI adoption patterns, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you've been about finding that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving your own expertise. Have a great rest of your day!
