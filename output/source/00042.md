Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's go

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The aim was to express milk proteins in yeast. I selected the appropriate yeast, Pichia pastoris, for high protein level expression, chose an initial protein to express (beta casein), derived the sequence and codon optimised for expression in Pichia. I chose a constitutive promoter and designed my own plasmid from scratch. The plasmid contained the GAP promoter,  alpha factor signal sequence, beta casein, AOX1 terminator, E.coli selection and replication genes, and the Pichia pastoris HIS4 gene for selection. AS it was designed myself, it is a royalty free expression system.

AI: That sounds like a sophisticated project - designing your own royalty-free expression system is impressive. 

Can you walk me through what happened after you designed the plasmid? How did you go from that design stage through to your final results?

User: After design, I started with a pUC57 backbone, and used standard PCR and cloning techniques to amplify the relevant genes from Pichia, and got the beta casein gene synthesised by an external provider. It was then a matter of cloning all the pieces into the plasmid and verifying with DNA sequencing. The final plasmid was cloned into Pichia and tested for expression.

AI: Thanks for walking me through that entire process - from initial design all the way through to testing expression in Pichia. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I have used AI to help decide on restriction enzymes, primer design and verification of plasmid design. I have asked it to scan sequences (which it isn't very good at, it has trouble counting) and codon optimise.

AI: That's really helpful to know you've tried AI for several different aspects - restriction enzyme selection, primer design, plasmid verification, sequence scanning, and codon optimization.

For the restriction enzyme selection specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that task.

User: I used AI originally to design a process that allows proper insertion of restriction endonucleases at the end of oligonucleotide primers, and are used in buffers that are compatible with each other, I don't want to have to do sequential RE steps. It was a method used to quickly identify potential options that I went and verified with the usual RE identification and selection process.

AI: That's a smart approach - using AI as a quick first pass to identify potential options before verifying through your established process.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the actual PCR amplification, cloning steps, or expression testing - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I didn't have access to any sort of high throughput equipment so PCR amplification, cloning and expression were all manual processes.

AI: That makes sense - those manual lab processes wouldn't really benefit from AI assistance in the way you were set up.

When you've used AI for tasks like restriction enzyme selection or primer design, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I use processes I have always used for 20 years. The AI screen allows me to reduce the amount of steps to get to the final answer, but I still use old fashioned sequence analysis software, restriction enzyme supplier catalogs etc, to verify the AI outputs and, if there is several options, to chose the best (maybe that is which enzymes we currently have in the freezer).

AI: That's a really practical approach - leveraging your 20 years of experience to validate AI outputs while still getting the efficiency benefit of AI as a screening tool.

We're about two-thirds through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would love to be able to trust AI to do the things I ask it to do correctly, and not have to double check everything. Whether that is primer design, prior art searches, anything. At the moment there are too many hallucinations to have any great degree of trust.

AI: That really gets to the heart of it - the verification burden that comes with AI hallucinations. It sounds like while AI can speed up your initial screening process, that lack of reliability means you're still doing all the traditional verification work anyway.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on using AI as a screening tool while maintaining rigorous verification processes was particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as an efficient screening tool while relying on your established 20-year expertise for validation really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The tension you highlighted between AI's potential efficiency gains and the need for rigorous verification due to hallucinations is something we hear about but it's valuable to understand how that plays out in practice for someone with your deep domain expertise.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!
