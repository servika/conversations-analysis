Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions to start with.  I'm ready to go.  Let's get started!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Over a year ago, we started analyzing explosive residue samples that would be found in soil.  EPA has a method for it called EPA Method 8330.  It typically employs the use of a UV or PDA detector and you have to test your samples with two different columns.  We were trying to innovate by using PDA as the first dimension and MS as the confirmatory dimension.  

We started first by getting standards and viewing them in scan mode both with positive and negative polarities.  We started on a TQ instrument for easier characterization and then moved over to a single quad in tandem with a PDA.  We were able to find most residues with a DUIS source on the 2050, but on the 8060 we could see everything, with great sensitivity when ionizing with APCI.

AI: That sounds like a really complex analytical chemistry project with multiple instrument configurations. Tell me more about that process - what were the key stages you went through from that initial idea of using PDA and MS together to actually getting those results on the different instruments?

User: First, we needed input from the field.  What are they currently doing, and how do they want to improve? After receiving that feedback we had a set of analytes to test.  Finding proper transitions with these very finnicky chemicals was very difficult.  These are usually analyzed via LC-UV or GCMS, but our collaborator wanted LCMS.  

With these clearly defined goals we determined what the dynamic range of the compounds would be.  We found after system optimization that we could meet the sensitivity requirements of the EPA method and then continued to figure out how to generate a method where all analytes could be detected in a single run as temperature really affected ionization efficiency.

We found a happy medium and have shown this data at conferences and our collaborator is excited to see the progress we have made.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you had to balance a lot of technical constraints while meeting those EPA sensitivity requirements. The temperature effects on ionization efficiency sound particularly challenging to work around.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Searching for likely adducts or in-source fragmentation products has been very helpful.  The analytes don't always generate a predictable precursor ion, and having a resource to brainstorm with was very helpful.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a brainstorming partner for those unpredictable precursor ions makes a lot of sense. Tell me more about that process. When you hit one of those challenging analytes that wasn't giving you the expected precursor ion, how did you approach using AI to help figure out what might be happening?

User: We would give a prompt like, 'We are trying to detect 2-nitrobenzene. It has a MW of 123.11 g/mol. We would predict to see an [M+H] precursor of 124 and an [M-H] of 122.  We aren't seeing these.  Nor are we an M+ or M- ion.  Are there any records that might suggest in-source fragmentation?  What other transformations might happen that we should consider?"

AI: That's a really specific and methodical way to use AI - essentially having it help you think through the possible chemical transformations when your expected ions don't show up. 

For that specific task of troubleshooting unexpected ionization behavior, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of maybe consulting literature or discussing with colleagues.

User: We did all of it.  We worked as a team to try to figure this out and we had various ideas.  We also consulted literature.  The LLMs we used leveraged search capabilities so we felt that it could be like another researcher that might have a valid point of view compiled from established literature, online notes and blogs.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - treating the AI as another team member with its own perspective rather than replacing your traditional methods. It sounds like you saw it as complementary to your literature searches and team discussions.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the other parts of your research process - from that initial field input gathering, through method development, optimization, and presenting at conferences - what's kept you from trying AI in those other areas?

User: Sometimes we have been able to accomplish this on our own.  Other times we already have tools that we want to share in our publications that are proprietary to our organization.  Security of LLMs isn't known or entirely trusted yet.  

On other projects we have asked for help with method development or for inspiration to get over the writer's block or paralysis that happens when beginning the creation of a technical note or a conference presentation.

For one member of the group it has been more an issue of "learning something new."  It is still early on and we are trying to find where it fits best.  We've also had it code some interactive games to create engaging educational content.

AI: That's a really honest picture - it sounds like there are both practical concerns around security with proprietary information and also just the natural learning curve of figuring out where AI fits best in your workflow.

When you have used AI for things like getting over writer's block or method development inspiration, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: Our experience helps a lot.  We all of graduate degrees. We also review things as a group.  If there are assumptions made that are untrue or we are unsure about we either present the LLM with the proper data to aid in training or we just rely on what we know to be the facts.

AI: That makes perfect sense - using your collective expertise and peer review process to catch any issues. It sounds like you treat AI outputs with the same scrutiny you'd apply to any other information source that needs validation.

We're approaching the end of our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Generating expert level collateral with minimal user input.  I would love to have a template that asks for inputs and data and outputs beautiful report or presentation with figures, data processing and representation without the hours involved to write and the difficulty some have in writing in a language that is foreign to them.

AI: That's a compelling vision - essentially having AI handle the entire translation from raw data and inputs into polished, professional scientific communication. That would address both the time burden and language barriers that can be real obstacles in sharing scientific work.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a collaborative brainstorming tool while maintaining rigorous validation practices were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: If you could ask me any other question, what would you ask?

AI: That's a great question! If I could ask you one more thing, it would be:

When you're working with your team and someone suggests using AI for a particular task, what's the conversation like? How do you all decide together whether it's worth trying, and have you noticed any differences in how team members approach or feel about using AI in your research?

I'm curious about the team dynamics around AI adoption, especially since you mentioned one team member finding it more challenging to learn something new.

User: It is usually met with interest.  We all understand the team member who is hesitant.  They don't truly mind the information that comes from AI, but they also don't confident in "piloting" it for themselves.  I was the first to use it and when I showed what I was able to create with AI for a first draft of a PowerPoint presentation, they were astounded.  We reviewed what was created and noticed some amazing capabilities and some shortcomings.  Essentially, it proved that this can help us streamline our workload and that is how we use it.  We all have the expectation that we don't take anything as "the truth" from AI, because that isn't what we do as scientists.  Everything must be tested for legitimacy so that the best research can be done and shared.

AI: That's a wonderful way to put it - "we don't take anything as 'the truth' from AI, because that isn't what we do as scientists." It sounds like your scientific training naturally equipped your team with exactly the right mindset for working with AI tools.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about treating AI as another team member while maintaining rigorous validation, and especially how you're thinking about AI's potential for streamlining scientific communication, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your perspective has been incredibly valuable!

User: Thank you! I have enjoyed this conversation as well.  I hope we can continue in the future.

AI: Thank you so much! I really enjoyed our conversation too - your thoughtful approach to integrating AI into analytical chemistry research was fascinating to hear about. I hope we get the chance to continue this dialogue in the future as well. Take care!

User: Cheers!

AI: Cheers! Have a great rest of your day!
