Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, I don't have any questions before we start

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I always have AI (through a work enterprise account) open in a browser on my work machine. I made a custom GPT that has company design standards and some industry standards uploaded to it. When completing review of documents that outside consultants prepare, I frequently query this custom GPT to confirm the content of said documents align with our internal and industry standards. I also use the GPT to find state regulations and guidance to confirm what I am reviewing aligns with state standards. I have attempted to automate some easy and repetitive tasks, like document summarization to GPT, however I have had mixed results in doing so. I will occasionally use GPT to rewrite an email if I'm feeling exceptionally frustrated and I'm concerned that my emotion is coming across in an email. Finally, I use GPT alot to teach or remind me how to do specific things with different pieces of software. This is mostly Microsoft Office and Salesforce, but also occasionally AutoCAD Civil 3D, obsidian, and HydroCAD.

AI: That's really interesting how you've integrated AI into so many different aspects of your work. I'd like to dig deeper into something you mentioned.

You said you've had mixed results with document summarization automation. Tell me more about that - what's been working and what hasn't?

User: I feed an outside document from a subject matter expert about a project site to the GPT along with an example of a previously completed analysis, and a blank company template to export the analysis on. I also provide some high-level instruction on what these documents are and what to do. While the model can often do most of the analysis, it consistently cannot export it on the template as a word doc with correct formatting. The model also still regularly hallucinates so I have to check its work. At that point I might as well just do the analysis myself because it doesn't save me any time to have AI complete it.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - if you have to double-check everything anyway, the time savings disappear. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are alot of tasks I complete that AI cannot yet do, like drawing review. Even if AI could assist with this, the stakes are too high if a mistake is made so I would always want to complete the review myself. If I thought AI would not make mistakes I could feed it a list of diligence-related questions and documents and have it complete all of the background diligence for me and organize that material. Alot of the work I do as a civil engineer is hyper site specific. In order to adequately evaluate a site I have to know the state regulations, background and goals of the project, site restrictions and limitations, property owner preferences, equipment limits, and in general how to best design a site. Often I review externally designed sites that could have been done better and I have to know on what and how to question our external consultants. Making just one mistake or missing a regulation or permit could kill a multi-million dollar project so I would never leave that solely up to AI. There are also things in my field that aren't written down anywhere, they're just learned by experience and overtime you build intuition. I don't know how you would even train an AI model to learn that.

AI: That's a really compelling point about the stakes being too high for certain tasks. The multi-million dollar project risk definitely changes the calculus.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It's usually a conversation where I ask it for a deliverable and then I review and request revisions on that deliverable. Unless the prompt is very limited in scope, AI never returns a fully correct deliverable.

AI: So it sounds like it's more of an iterative back-and-forth process rather than a one-and-done delegation.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Yes, we have a company enterprise account and there is significant pressure from the C-suite to adopt AI on an individual level as well as team-level initiatives to demonstrate to the C-suite how we are best implementing AI in our workflows.

AI: That's an interesting dynamic - pressure from leadership to adopt AI. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When I was trying to get AI to complete this summarization of an external document task, the one I discussed above, and AI just could not get the formatting right. I would get it to correct one line of formatting and then it would drop some content. It was so frustrating. The GPT also kept telling me it did what I asked when it didn't. When I finally asked if it was even capable of doing what I was asking (formatting wise) it admitted that it couldn't. That was kind of a last straw for me and I took a month break from working with it on that particular task. I also once asked it a question about state guidance and then shared that response with my boss, but when I looked at the source I found out the AI had hallucinated, and I had to share that with my boss. Luckily I had framed it as, "the GPT said..." otherwise it could have been a very embarrassing situation.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - especially when it kept insisting it had done what you asked when it clearly hadn't. And that hallucination incident with your boss must have been a wake-up call about verification.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not sure I understand that questions

AI: Let me clarify that question. You mentioned using AI for things like helping with software tutorials or rewriting emails when you're frustrated. Do you ever worry about becoming too dependent on AI for certain skills, or think about making sure you maintain your own abilities in those areas?

User: I have always been very intentional about using my brain. For example, I regularly force myself to use mental math when I have the urge to reach for a calculator. Most people are probably not like me in that way. I also only use mapping apps when I absolutely have to, I prefer to know how to get places using my own brain power, this helps to consistently maintain brain health. That being said, I don't think the things I'm asking AI to do are things that I will lose my skills at. I would be more concerned about my children never gaining those skills in the first place. I use AI to do alot that I would previously have used a google search for, so all that's doing is saving me from parsing through search results - a skill I can survive without. But my children are young and have never had to learn how to parse through information to determine what is valuable and what is crap. How will they evaluate the output of AI in the future when they've never had to do that themselves?

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - maintaining your own skills versus your children never developing them in the first place. The concern about information evaluation skills is particularly interesting.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I am hoping AI improves and can actually do these repetitive tasks that I don't enjoy doing and that I don't add anymore value to than AI can. I will continue to use AI for workplace advice and revisions to written communication. Where AI is most exciting to me, which is laterally related here, is in handling my mental load as a working mom. I would rather spend my brain power at my job than deciding what to make for dinner from the ingredients in my fridge.

AI: That's such an insightful way to think about it - optimizing where you spend your brain power. The mental load example really highlights how AI's value might extend beyond just work tasks.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the high-stakes nature of your engineering work and how that shapes your trust boundaries with AI, as well as your concerns about skill development for the next generation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: We used AI to make a team GPT and then had it brainstorm its own name for us and make a graphic of itself - since we're a team of civil engineers it came up with a civil related name and a cartoon of a civil engineer in the field with items representing our industry. It helped us to bond as a team, and was swiftly copied by every other team in our department.

AI: That's a wonderful example of AI facilitating team building in an unexpected way! It sounds like it became a kind of creative catalyst that spread throughout your department.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of integrating AI into high-stakes engineering work, the challenges with formatting and verification, and even that creative team-building example will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you've been about both the frustrations and the successes. Take care!
