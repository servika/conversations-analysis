Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: My role at work is varied, so I use AI for a wide range of things. I use it to pre-plan and write all of our social posts and content, including ideas for images. On occasion we use it for bid writing. I regularly use it construct letters and emails, generate posters and occasionally for creating lesson plans. I also use it come up with fundraising ideas.

AI: That's quite a range of applications! It sounds like AI has become a regular part of your toolkit across many different types of work.

When you mention using AI for all these different tasks - from social posts to lesson plans to fundraising ideas - I'm curious about your preferences. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I wouldn't say there are tasks that I prefer to handle myself. It's more that I need to use AI as a template and then alter its output to be more specific or tailored for our needs. For example, it may not be up to date with the latest Dfe Guidance, so I can't fully rely on it's knowledge.

AI: That's a really helpful distinction - so you're finding AI works well as a starting point, but you need to bring your specialized knowledge to refine and customize the output.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Definitely collaborate, although it would be great to be able to fully delegate!

AI: Tell me more about that collaboration process. What does that back-and-forth typically look like for you?

User: Typically it involves refining the response. For example, I recently had AI plan a terms worth of Facebook posts for our school. Some of the hashtags used weren't in keeping with our tone, or felt too Americanised. Collaboration comes from me refining the response to something useable.

AI: That's a great example - I can see how those cultural nuances and brand voice elements would need your input to get right.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: The majority of our colleagues are hesitant to use AI and not well versed in it. I use AI through my own initiative, but we're receiving AI training soon as a whole staff. For those that do use it, we influence each other in ideas for how it can help our work day. For example, it was a big help in student report writing at the end of last term and we saw more teachers using it.

AI: It's interesting that you're kind of a pioneer in your workplace with AI use. You mentioned that AI was helpful for student report writing and more teachers started using it after seeing that success.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes. This is a very niche situation but every year we have a pop-up swimming pool that arrives to our school for lessons. It's my job to schedule a timetable with impossible constraints. For example, we have 84 children, need to allocate them to groups of less than 12, taking into account that the Year 5 group aren't there on a Thursday or Year 4 can't swim in the mornings. Each student needs to receive the same number of lessons. In order to make this significantly easier this year I uploaded the list of children with their abilities, added in all of the constraints and scheduling considerations and asked AI to make the timetable. This saved hours of work.

AI: That sounds like it was incredibly satisfying - taking what must have been a really complex puzzle and having AI help you solve it efficiently! That's such a specific example of how AI can handle those multi-constraint optimization problems that would be so time-consuming to work through manually.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, especially as the bulk of my role is administrative tasks that are very likely to be taken over by AI. I view it as my role is evolving into one of managing AI. There will still be a need to think through how to effectively prompt the AI and monitor the output.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to think about it - repositioning yourself as an AI manager rather than seeing it as replacement. It sounds like you're already developing those prompting and quality control skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Time is always scarce in a school environment. If I can learn to manage using AI for more mundane and time consuming tasks this would allow me to spend more time on projects that AI can't fully help with (like fundraising, or interviewing children). I imagine it will become a more effective partnership where I use it as often as I use email.

AI: That's a really compelling vision - AI becoming as integral to your daily workflow as email is now, but specifically freeing you up for those more human-centered aspects of your work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how your role is evolving into managing AI rather than being replaced by it, and that swimming pool scheduling example was brilliant - such a perfect illustration of AI handling complex constraints.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you for your time!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about being an early adopter in your school environment, the collaborative approach you've developed, and especially how you're thinking about skill evolution will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today. Have a great rest of your day!
