Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. No questions. Go ahead.

AI: Great, thank you. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently I use AI to write documentation, provide training materials, and validate my understanding of software development processes. My company also incorporates AI into some of our applications so as someone that works in QA/test, I will also evaluate summarizations to make sure that our AI is performing as it should. It depends on what tasks I am working on, but I generally use AI at least once a day.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're using AI both as a tool for your own work and also evaluating AI systems as part of your QA role.

When you're using AI for those documentation and training tasks, could you walk me through what that typically looks like? Are you starting from scratch with AI, or are you bringing it existing materials to work with?

User: It depends on what I am trying to do. I will often write some documentation and then ask AI to rewrite it or maybe format it in a different way. We recently migrated from Confluence to SharePoint and I provided training for numerous aspects of that. For that I used AI to give me an outline of what training that specific piece of the migration would be. I would alter it and ask for AI to expand on my revisions to make sure we covered the aspects that I felt were important for my company.

AI: That's a really interesting collaborative approach - you're not just handing off complete tasks but going back and forth with AI to refine and build on the work together.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: My company deals with legal software and we have some confidentiality. Anything related to confidentiality, I would handle myself. For more general information I will work with the AI. While we do work with the AI while testing summarizations, I would not rely on AI to help me verify that those summarizations are correct. I believe there needs to be more maturity there before I start using AI in testing other than potentially helping to write test automation.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're drawing clear boundaries around confidential information and being cautious about using AI to validate other AI systems.

When you do work with AI for those general tasks like documentation and training materials, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Generally I will pick an area that I would like to document - let's say SharePoint Lists. I would ask for a summarization of SharePoint lists. Once I had that, I would ask to remove or add certain features, and review again. I would probably ask for it to break down the information in a certain way and possibly format it. There would be some back and forth on changing a few things, maybe adding a checklist - or removing certain items to be put in another area of the documentation. So it would be a collaboration. I don't think I have delegated complete tasks. It would be rare that I would do that.

AI: That iterative, back-and-forth approach you're describing sounds very collaborative. You're really shaping the output through multiple rounds of feedback and refinement.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: While we use AI in our products, and I believe the software development team has tried it for coding, we are just getting started with using AI. I am probably an early adopter and use it more than others. We have a new initiative to use it in the company so I would imagine we will have a lot more use, but colleagues haven't influenced me. We do have a culture where we learn and do what we need to help our job, so that might be a way it has influenced me.

AI: So you're kind of pioneering the way forward for AI use at your company - being that early adopter while others are still getting started. That learning culture you mentioned sounds like it gives you the freedom to explore these tools.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I recently had a discussion with regards to why we do requirements reviews and the purpose of requirements. I asked three questions to AI about this, and it validated my thoughts, and I was impressed at the detail that it provided. So that was a time it satisfied me. When testing our AI, we had some data we brought into the system, and one was a drivers licenses. It frustrated me that the AI did such a poor job with the text summary. I ran the same data through another AI tool and it was much better. It is frustrating that model choices, or even slight changes in prompts can make such a difference.

AI: That's really insightful - you experienced both the validation of having AI confirm and expand on your professional knowledge, and also the frustration of seeing inconsistent performance between different AI systems on the same task.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think that AI can help in some ways, and while I would probably want to maintain my skills in those areas, there are other skills in my field that I think take human thinking and I don't think we are there AI-wise yet, so I would prefer to maintain and improve my skills in those areas, and allow AI to help me where it can.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - focusing on developing the distinctly human skills while leveraging AI as a complement. It sounds like you see AI as a tool that frees you up to focus on higher-level thinking.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As a manager there are a number of administrative tasks that I think AI can help with. We are setting up in house AI which should allow us to use AI more without confidentiality concerns. We are also looking to do test automation and there are aspects that would take time to research, like authenticating through third-party tools, that could be researched using AI, and even potentially providing the code. I can also envision the ability to know where changes in the code might affect test cases allowing us to be able to target regression testing. I definitely see an expansion on how we use AI. Where I was only using it infrequently maybe six months ago, I now use it daily.

AI: That trajectory from infrequent use to daily use really shows how quickly this integration can happen once you find the right applications. The in-house AI solution you mentioned sounds like it could be a game-changer for addressing those confidentiality concerns.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on drawing clear boundaries around confidential information while still finding creative ways to collaborate with AI on general tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about being an early adopter in your organization, the collaborative approach you've developed, and how you're thinking strategically about AI's role in different aspects of your work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
