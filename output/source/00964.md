Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I don't have any questions, let's begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to do a variety of things throughout a day. This could include: to write a snippet of CSS to adjust something on a website I'm designing; to write an email to a client to summarize work I've done; to suggest a list of content topics for one of my clients (for example, a master electrician who needed to communicate the fact that he has expertise in working with Smart Home technology); to rewrite a sentence that I am struggling with; to make a workflow plan for a busy day in which I need to accomplish many things. Or to help me brainstorm new directions to take my business.

AI: That's a really diverse range of tasks. It sounds like AI has become quite integrated across different aspects of your work - from the technical side with CSS to client communication and strategic thinking.

When you mention using it for things like rewriting a sentence you're struggling with or brainstorming business directions, tell me more about that. What does that interaction typically look like?

User: Usually if I get AI to rewrite a sentence, what I'm really looking for is a way to break myself out of my own brain tangle. I don't usually use any of the sentences that the AI suggests, but I will grasp a word or phrase and work that in to what I want to say. There are times when I use AI like a thinking partner—when I worked in advertising years ago I had an art director partner and we worked as a team, and I have always found it useful to bounce ideas off of another brain. I work solo now and I haven't had that opportunity for years. So AI can perform that function in a reasonably good way.  Sometimes, in a surprisingly good way.

AI: That's fascinating - the idea of AI as a thinking partner rather than just a tool to generate final output. The comparison to your art director partner really illustrates how you're using it for creative collaboration.

When you say it sometimes works "in a surprisingly good way" as that thinking partner, can you walk me through what that looks like? What happens in those moments that surprises you?

User: The surprisingly good way of it can be that the AI takes me in directions I would not have considered, or sees patterns in my thinking that I don't grasp. For example, when brainstorming ideas of areas to take my business it (it's almost always ChatGPT as I have a Pro subscription) suggested that I could take a leadership role in strategic thinking for content and communication because of the way that I can articulate strategy and direction. This was a surprising insight and has compelled me to rethink my offering.

AI: That's a powerful example - where the AI essentially helped you see your own strengths and capabilities from an outside perspective. It sounds like it was able to synthesize different aspects of what you'd shared and reflect back something you hadn't fully recognized about yourself.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned a range of tasks where you use it - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I usually rely on my own research when I'm writing content. I don't use AI summaries when I do a google search and I don't ask GPT research-type questions. My concern is relying on research generated by AI may mean there are mistakes or inaccuracies in the research and I don't want to waste time ensuring that the information I've received is accurate. I also don't ask AI to write anything creative. I also write short stories, and I have yet to read anything creative written by an AI that is at the level of excellence that I like to read, therefore I would not ask it to write a story, novel or poem. I do, however, use it occasionally to outline ideas for stories.

AI: That's really insightful - you've drawn clear boundaries around where you trust AI versus where you maintain direct control. The research point is particularly interesting - it sounds like you've calculated that the time spent verifying AI-generated research isn't worth the potential time savings.

And with creative writing, you're willing to use it for structural help like outlining, but not for the actual creative output itself.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: My typical pattern is to attend to matters that I feel certain about on my own and use AI to troubleshoot errors or answer concise queries if I run into them. However, for anything website-design related (especially HTML, CSS or Javascript), I ask the AI before attempting to solve the problem myself. I have discovered that the fastest path to solving any errors of a code nature is to use AI.

AI: That's a really pragmatic approach - you've clearly identified where AI gives you the biggest efficiency gains. The contrast is interesting: you do your own research to avoid verification time, but with coding issues you go straight to AI because you've found it's actually faster than troubleshooting yourself.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you mentioned working solo now, I'm curious about how you've navigated figuring out these AI usage patterns on your own.

User: I am a freelancer and AI came into its own while I was freelancing. At the time, however, I was working in a contract capacity with a startup that was building a following, and I was encouraged to use AI to outline the content I was writing for them at the time. 

Can you clarify what you mean by the second part of your question please?: "I'm curious about how you've navigated figuring out these AI usage patterns on your own." I am not sure what you seek, information-wise, here.

AI: Of course! What I meant is - since you work solo as a freelancer, you don't have office colleagues to learn from or compare notes with about AI usage. So I'm curious how you figured out your current approach to using AI. 

Did you experiment on your own to find what works? Learn from online communities? Or was it more trial and error to discover things like "AI is great for coding problems but I prefer doing my own research"?

User: Ah, thank you. Trial and error, for sure. At first I don't think I realized the potential of AI as a work partner (as it were), but I got a project to write copy for an industry I couldn't quite wrap my head around (third-party logistics, or 3PL) and I asked the AI many (many!) questions to define terminology, how 3PL works, who uses it, what this phrase means, how it benefits a small business, medium-sized business, large business (etc.). This experience really showed me the utility of using AI and after that I turned to it constantly to help solve problems and answer questions.

AI: That 3PL project sounds like a real turning point - where AI went from being something you occasionally used to becoming a regular problem-solving partner. It's interesting how tackling an unfamiliar industry helped you discover that questioning and clarifying capability.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI made me feel particularly satisfied in that 3PL experience. After submitting the copy, the client said that "they'd never been so well understood by a copywriter before" and that was fantastically satisfying. On the other hand, just today I had a particularly frustrating experience when I was trying to troubleshoot why my files weren't pushing to github from VS Code—the AI gave me such roundabout troubleshooting steps when all I needed to do was get a classic token versus a fine-grained token to set the password for access. (If this sounds garbled it's because I am still annoyed.)

AI: That contrast is so telling! The 3PL success where your client felt truly understood - that must have been incredibly validating, especially knowing AI helped you get there. 

And I can hear the frustration in your voice about today's GitHub issue. It sounds like the AI overcomplicated something that had a simple solution, and you're still feeling that annoyance of being led down the wrong path when you just needed a straightforward answer.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: The weird thing for me is that so far AI has only augmented and increased my skills. As a freelance creative I am asked to solve so many different problems over the course of the average week that so far AI has helped me be able to confidently say yes to more and different projects. It's an "AI has my back" sort of deal, I think. I recognize that AI could and likely will take over many of the things I am doing but so far my experience of clients is that they are a) afraid of or quite dubious of AI b) have used it but not been able to get the results they want or c) simply do not want to use AI for the tasks they ask me to do. So at present I find AI to be more helpful than dangerous (in terms of it taking work away from me).

AI: That "AI has my back" feeling is such a powerful way to put it - it sounds like it's become an enabling force that actually expands what you feel confident taking on, rather than something that competes with you.

And your point about client attitudes is really interesting - that they're either wary of AI or haven't had success with it themselves, so they still value having you as the human intermediary who knows how to work with these tools effectively.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I expect it will become more integrated, more an extension of myself than it already is. That being said, I haven't felt that there's been much evolution in the capabilities of AI in the last six months or so...that is to say, my use of it hasn't become more complex or different so it's hard to envision a further evolution at present. Although perhaps it will give me the ability to expand even further if I start to use it even more as a partner than an employee...if I could trust its output fully and if it was able to write content/communications materials and design with my voice and style then it could help me increase my output  substantially.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - between using AI as an "employee" versus a true "partner." It sounds like the barrier to that deeper partnership is still that trust and consistency piece - being able to rely on AI to capture your voice and style reliably.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a thinking partner and how it's actually expanded your confidence to take on new projects.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Just, perhaps that AI's tendency toward agreeing versus challenging makes it occasionally a too-agreeable work partner. It does challenge my ideas on occasion but it would be interesting to have a little more pushback on occasion. That being said, I suppose I could ask the AI to really workshop ideas with me more often.

AI: That's such a valuable insight - the idea that AI might be almost too accommodating as a thinking partner. It's interesting that you mention you could probably ask it to be more challenging, but it sounds like that doesn't come naturally in the interaction the way it might with a human collaborator who would push back more instinctively.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI as both enabler and thinking partner, and how you've navigated building that relationship through trial and error, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
