Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no further questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I do tutoring, so I have to often write feedback reports for my students. I often use AI to help me with this. For example, when I am tutoring, during the class I will take notes and write down various points such as errors or areas of improvement for the students. AI is helpful for me in summarising this information into a clear feedback report, saving time for me and improving my efficiency. Moreover, feedback reports can feel quite repetitive and mundane, and I find that I end up just saying the same kinds of things, so AI helps with this as well. The actual teaching element is much more personal, tailored, and human, so I don't use AI for this.

AI: That's a really clear example of how you've found a specific niche where AI adds value. You mentioned that the actual teaching feels more personal and human to you. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I would definitely prefer to handle tasks that are more about human connection myself. For example, I think some people could easily use AI to almost come up with a script for using when they are teaching a lesson. This feels inauthentic to me. Moreover, there are certain points where I refrain from using AI to keep up my own intellectual and creative thinking capabilities, as I don't want to become overly reliant on AI and thus lose my intelligence. Therefore in lessons, when I am speaking to students and thinking of ways they could speak English better or different styles of wording they could use, I try and think of this myself on the spot, rather than having AI on the side.

AI: That's fascinating - you're making really intentional choices about preserving your own intellectual capabilities. You mentioned not wanting to become overly reliant and lose your intelligence.

When you do use AI for those feedback reports, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the task, or do you tend to delegate the complete task for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to just delegate the task completely - for example, if I want to provide paraphrasing and grammatical correction suggestions, I will copy and paste the original sentence and ask AI to provide these for me. However, majority of the time I do filter through these - eg. I try and consider which of the sentences are the best, which sound the most natural, etc. and I do vet through these or try and edit them myself

AI: That's interesting - so you delegate the initial generation but then you're actively curating and editing the results. It sounds like you maintain that final quality control layer.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I work completely remotely actually so I don't think there's any direct influence in terms of workplace culture. However, all the other tutors I know use AI in the same way, and I learned how to use it and apply it as a tool in this way by speaking to others.

AI: That makes sense - so even working remotely, you've picked up usage patterns through conversations with other tutors.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think AI can be frustrating when it is unnatural. For me, sounding natural, with wording and speech patterns that native speakers may typically use, it the most essential. Therefore at times, when AI can perhaps be too literal or too unnatural, this is frustrating, as it feels as though AI has just missed the mark

AI: That frustration with unnaturalness really comes through - it sounds like when AI misses those nuances that you as a native speaker can immediately recognize, it creates more work for you rather than saving time.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't actively worry about this too much but I do have an underlying awareness of this. I don't think there is much point in resisting AI's takeover in certain areas, or putting a lot of effort into continuing to enhance and hone these skills. For example, the skill of editing - this is something that used to be one of my strengths, and is being heavily replaced by AI. Whilst I am leaning into it and using AI, I always try and make an active effort to maintain this skill by vetting whatever AI said. But otherwise, I think it is better right now to start developing new AI-specific skills (eg. writing good prompts)

AI: That's a really pragmatic approach - accepting the shift while still maintaining oversight. You mentioned developing "AI-specific skills" like writing good prompts as the new focus.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think my relationship with AI will increase - most likely, I will keep using AI with increasing frequency. I think AI itself will keep improving as well, therefore perhaps I won't need to be double checking or vetting answers as much. However, I don't think the human element will ever be replaced.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you're strategically choosing which skills to maintain versus which ones to let AI handle, and your clear boundaries around preserving the human elements of teaching.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, thanks

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that balance between efficiency and authenticity, especially in a field like tutoring where human connection is so central, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
