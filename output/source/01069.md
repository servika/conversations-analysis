Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, sounds good.  I am ready to proceed.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I currently use AI for my two small businesses, that are completely different kinds of work.  One is an aquarium business and the other is in selling motorcycle, parts and accessories. 
I mainly use it for writing website descriptions for products, Shopify tutorials when encountering coding/backend issues, bike graphics design ideas, tax help, water quality parameters for different size aquariums and tank build design ideas.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across such different domains. It sounds like you're leveraging it for both creative and technical challenges.

When you mention using AI for water quality parameters and tank build design ideas for your aquarium business, what does that process typically look like for you?

User: Well, I have small home aquariums as well as large commercial aquariums.  I have to test different parameters of the water quality and the different size tanks require different amounts of chemicals and readings.  The tank build ideas are for when I am setting up aquariums for new customers and they are trying to get an idea of the size tank, the colors of the wood stand, what type of glass/acrylic, if it will fit within the location they want it and to give them an idea of what the tank might look like(that aspect has been challenging with AI image qualities versus what I input).

AI: Tell me more about that challenge with AI image quality versus what you input. What specifically happens when you're trying to show customers what their tank might look like?

User: The images rendered have not really been true to the design ideas we have input into the AI and the quality of image has not been the best as well as the images take a bit of time to create.  I visit with a client in their home at an estimate appointment to give them a general idea of what their aquarium tank idea would look like.On a side note, I have a tank builder that custom build these aquariums so the customers ideas of how they want their tank can all be built but they typically want to have a general idea of its appearance before placing a deposit for the build contract.

AI: That sounds like a real practical challenge when you're sitting there with a client waiting. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer sourcing my supplies/products on my own, I don't want suggestions from AI for retail places to purchase things especially when I am with a customer and using it for business use only.  I prefer right now using AI as a trusted resource and helper for the tasks that I execute on my own but need guidance or specialized information.  When AI becomes more integrated I would like more automation but I am not ready to entirely hand it all over yet.

AI: That's really insightful - you're drawing a clear line between using AI as a trusted advisor versus having it make purchasing decisions that could affect your business relationships.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate.  I have what I need to do and achieve in my head but maybe don't have all of the knowledge or just having a day with a brain block where I can't think of something or just need a shortcut to getting it achieved quicker, that is when I will refer to AI.

AI: That collaboration approach makes a lot of sense - using AI to fill in knowledge gaps or overcome those mental blocks we all have.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or since you run your own businesses, how do your customers or suppliers react when they know you're using AI tools?

User: I don't have a workplace culture as it is a small business with my husband and I running everything.  My husband is slow to get on board with a lot of the AI integration, he still writes customers receipts on a carbon paper book lol.  The customers on the other hand are generally excited when I use AI, but some do tend to get a bit reluctant if I take a picture of their home with it.

AI: That's an interesting contrast - your husband preferring the carbon paper receipts while customers are generally excited about AI use. 

Tell me more about that reluctance when you take pictures of their homes. What specifically concerns them in those moments?

User: I take pictures to use when generating tank build ideas and to see what it would look like in the space.  I think it's a privacy thing for some, they may not want it used in the wrong way or some have said they were concerned as to where the image goes and who has access to pictures of their home.

AI: That makes complete sense - there's a real vulnerability in having pictures of your personal space processed by AI systems.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have felt pretty satisfied when inputting information lots of information and AI has created a spreadsheet almost instantly whereas it would have taken me a good 1/2 hour or so to create the same thing in Excel.  Now for the most part the spreadsheets have been pretty good with only a few text or cell errors, but overall quicker than what I could have done.  The frustrated goes back to the image generation and accuracy in size, color and overall look of what the idea was input not matching what was generated.  The client and I typically get a good laugh, but I do wish it was more reliable in that aspect.

AI: It sounds like there's a clear divide between your satisfaction with AI's text and data processing versus the ongoing challenges with visual accuracy. The spreadsheet example is a great illustration of AI really delivering on that time-saving promise.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have considered that and it is a bit daunting.  I have tended to get lazy in some areas where I rely on AI because it's easier and saves time.t has not come to the point of complete reliance in any one aspect of our business yet, I don't think we will head that direction where we don't have any physical part.

AI: That awareness of getting "lazy in some areas" is really honest - it sounds like you're actively monitoring that balance between efficiency and maintaining your own capabilities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I do want several areas to evolve one being our social media.  We don't hire anyone and only input things ourselves and a week or so will go by without any presence.  This isn't good in an industry based on word of mouth and sales.  I would like to find a reliable AI that would be able to handle all of our accounts, and tailor each one based on the platform.  Another area I would like to see if AI could work is out finances but more so our taxes.  We have quarterly and annual taxes that have to be consistently maintained, information input, calculated, check sent etc.  I would want some trustworthy AI to take that over.

AI: Those are really strategic areas you're thinking about - social media consistency and tax management are such critical but time-consuming aspects of running small businesses.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on drawing clear boundaries around where you want AI help versus where you maintain control, especially with supplier relationships.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Well, small businesses are hard and they are usually run by ordinary people who have busy lives, kids etc.  A specialized AI for small businesses to help in any and all aspects would be amazing.  I have not encountered anyone AI that is all encompassing for a business.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the idea of a comprehensive AI solution designed specifically for the realities of small business owners who are juggling everything themselves. It sounds like the current landscape requires you to piece together different AI tools for different needs, rather than having something that understands the interconnected nature of running a small business.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency with control, the challenges of visual AI accuracy, and especially that vision for comprehensive small business AI support will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you've been about both the successes and frustrations - that honest perspective is exactly what helps us understand how these tools are actually working in the real world.

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you so much for participating - your insights were really enlightening. Have a great rest of your day!
