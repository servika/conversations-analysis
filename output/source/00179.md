Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sOUNDS GOOD

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In a typical day I don't use it very much. What I use it for the most is we have an AI enhanced search feature for our intranet and files library. There is also AI powered search for images that I don't typical need access to

AI: That's interesting - so you're primarily encountering AI through search functionality rather than direct interaction. 

Tell me more about that AI-enhanced search for your intranet and files. How does that change the way you find information compared to how you used to search before?

User: It makes it easier to find files when I don't know the exact name, it can help to find files just using context. I forgot to mention that we also use AI to take meeting notes for our team meetings

AI: That context-based search sounds really useful for finding files without exact names. 

You mentioned AI taking meeting notes for your team meetings - how does that work in practice? What happens with those AI-generated notes after the meeting?

User: Usually the AI generated notes are posted into the meeting chat section. I think it is a way for people who were absent to get a better understanding rather than formal agenda notes

AI: So it sounds like the AI notes serve more as a catch-up tool for absent team members rather than replacing traditional meeting documentation.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are some things related to writing emails that I tend to do that AI could certainly do, but I feel like I am capable to do them myself and I enjoy having something to do

AI: That's a really honest perspective - you're choosing to keep some email writing tasks even though AI could handle them because you find them manageable and actually enjoy having that work to do.

When you do use AI for work - like with that search functionality or the meeting notes - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I guess with search it has to be independent because there isn't much room for adjustment while searching it would just be to use another prompt. And for meeting notes it is similar as that just passively takes place in the background without having to think about it

AI: That makes sense - both of those AI tools are more like automated features that run independently rather than interactive collaboration.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your team has particular attitudes or approaches toward AI tools?

User: My direct team uses it sparingly, aside from what I already mentioned but I know that a lot of people across teh organization are excited about it and are trying to incorporate it more and more into their work

AI: So there's a bit of a contrast - your immediate team is more reserved in their AI use, while the broader organization seems more enthusiastic about expanding AI integration.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When trying to find documents with conventional search it can be frustrating but the AI search tool has been very good at understanding what I am looking for. Specifically looking for corporate credit card policy and it was able to pull associated documents

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like the AI search really solved a concrete problem you were having with finding specific policy documents.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do quite a bit of review so I do think AI could do what I do fairly easily, but I think that culturally at least at my job we need to have a human sign off that things have been done correctly

AI: That's an insightful point - you recognize that AI could technically handle your review work, but there's still an important human accountability layer that your workplace values.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'll probably use it more as it becomes more pertinent in my role but I likely won't seek to use it more than I currently do. I won't go out of my way to start using it

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're open to using AI more as it becomes naturally integrated into your role, but you're not actively seeking out new ways to incorporate it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful thoughts about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your honest perspective on choosing to keep certain tasks like email writing because you enjoy having that work to do, and your observation about the cultural need for human sign-off even when AI could technically handle the work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thats all

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about taking a measured approach to AI adoption - using it where it clearly adds value like with search, while being thoughtful about maintaining human involvement in areas like review work - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
