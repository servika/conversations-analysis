Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, I'm ready to start

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In a typical workday, if I'm doing CSR, which is customer service rep on the bike courier team, I'll use it to answer some longwinded emails of new client acquisitions. I'll also use it for writing emails for the company to current customers who have inquiries, problems, questions. I don't always use it for emails when I write them if its a quick message, but AIs are pretty useful for writing them most of the time.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're using AI to handle those longwinded emails from new clients or customer inquiries, what specifically makes you decide to bring AI into the process rather than writing the response yourself?

User: AIs can usually incorporate a good business like tone and shoot out an email really quickly. As long as you include all of the points and what you want to say in the prompt, which can be accomplished in 1-3 sentences, the AI will get it right. And people don't necessarily know or care that its an AI, especially if you add a human touch in there.

AI: Interesting - you mentioned adding a human touch. Can you tell me more about what that looks like in practice? How do you typically add that human element to the AI-generated emails?

User: I'll change the intro or touch up a sentence. Its hard to describe without it sitting in front of me, but theres a certain tone to AI writing that shows up. I use CHatgpt only, so its AI writing style sticks out more to me so the certain moments I want to touch up are obvious for me, but maybe not for receivers of the email

AI: That makes sense - you've developed a good eye for recognizing that AI style. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I don't have a strict policy for using AI, but when I'm doing emails or writeups for the site or clients, I'll run it through AI if I'm tired after a long day. For writing a very important email to a big client, which I do sometimes, I won't use an AI, because I want the personal voice to come through a touch. There's certain clients we deliver for that are long time partners, so it feels like I shouldn't dilineate it to an AI. There's probably other ways I could use an AI, like for helping with dispatch, if there's some AI that's really good at mapping routes efficiently and giving routes to riders so that they end up in useful places after their routes. Thats kind of the whole goal of a dispatch, but we never use AI for taht because its on the go and we have a sort of human pride for dispatching and most of the hearty "couriery" stuff.

AI: That's fascinating - you mentioned having "human pride for dispatching and most of the hearty 'couriery' stuff." Can you tell me more about what you mean by that? What makes those aspects feel like they should stay human?

User: We are a local bike courier company, so we're kind of on the outskirts of hte industry. Bike couriers don't get paid very well, and we are always on the edge, usually not in the "black" as they say. So you have to have a sense of pride and passion for the work, because most courier companies have died due to uber, skipthedishes, etc. Anyway, we are very grass roots and independent, and we dont use ebikes. There is a certain "grungy local bike courier" pride to everything we do. Dispatching is one of the main "limbs" of the courier company, and figuring out efficient routes and dilineation of tasks is basically half of the job, so we like to keep it human. I also think there is good to reason not to trust an AI for interlocking routing of delivery stuff, because it would be alot to plug in. Alot of work would have to be done on a model to figure all that out.

AI: That paints such a vivid picture of your company culture and values. It sounds like there's a real tension between maintaining that grungy, grassroots identity and using tools that could potentially help with efficiency.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Like I said, we mostly, or I mostly use it for emails. We don't try to expand the role of AI deeper into our work, and part of it is we just do stuff the old fashioned way without thinking about AI, and I think there would also be some resistance to using AI for lots of stuff. I think it could be used for client acquisition, analyzing where we could expand our role, maybe cutting out inefficiencies in where we deliver to, finding niches for us in the industry, I'm not sure. We don't really use AI for nearly as much as its probably capable of. Mostly doing emails, writeups, payroll, and mundane stuff, but it is really helpful for banging that stuff out.

AI: That's really insightful. When you do use AI for those emails and writeups, how do you typically work with it? Do you go back and forth refining the output, or is it more of a "give it instructions and use what comes back" approach?

User: When I do AI writing for anyhthing personally or for my courier company I'll look it through and give it a human touch like I was saying. I dont go crazy on the prompting to get an absolute exact output that I need, because I'd rather get a generally solid writeup and then touch it up myself, but maybe writing out a full exact prompt with complete instructions would be quicker if the AI got the writing right exactly on the first try

AI: That's a really practical approach - getting that solid foundation and then personalizing it. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned there might be some resistance to using AI for lots of stuff - can you tell me more about that dynamic?

User: I have some older colleagues that have been doing the bike courier independent thing where everyone chips in and shares the work for a long time. They are more old fashioned, and remember the good old times. I don't think they would mind if mundane tasks like payroll or simpler emails were standardized with AI use, but bigger tasks to expand the company, find niches, or brainstorm how to beat the big guys or something might not be as accepted. I'm not a loud voice in the meetings we have, and I haven't tried to expand AIs usage at the company, but maybe I could try or think about it. It isn't absolutely mandatory for our day to day, but it could probably come in and help the big picture of the company alot

AI: It sounds like you see potential there but haven't pushed the conversation yet. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sometimes on a busy day, getting a few emails hammered out is really helpful. During the peak hours of the courier day around lunch-3pm it gets quite hectic and we gotta get on the phone, talk to the riders through radio dispatch, and figure everything out. Also, sometimes theres issues that need to be resolvved quickly through email, so there's times where the AI writeups are super helpful even unedited. I don't have any frustrating stories, since AI isn't used all the time for everything, its usually pretty helpful

AI: That's great that it's been consistently helpful for you. It sounds like having that quick turnaround during those hectic peak hours is really valuable.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: At my job at the couriers I don't think AI will really replace anyone, especially because we all kind of share in administrative accounting and higher up work. It's kind of a worker commune sort of deal, and we are very wary of people getting good hours and pay for their efforts. There's no aspect tahts really replaceable at the moment, especially because of our workers first culture. If the AI got really good at routing and dispatching, that would take out alot of stress and workload, but I don't think our company would ever do that. Like I said, we're very "worker first" and would heavily resist replacing a big role with AI.

AI: That worker-first culture sounds really strong. It's interesting how your company values seem to create natural boundaries around AI use.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: In the immediate future, I don't see it changing at all. But I'd like to look into how we could use AI to automate payroll, some more tedious tasks, and maybe to refine our client list or be better for dispatching. I haven't done much research or effort into expanding t he role of AI, because like I said, our company isn't exactly expanding into the modern age, but It's something worth considering that might make us a formidable contender in the wasteland of couriers we have today in major cities.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how your company's grassroots culture and worker-first values create this interesting balance with AI adoption - using it for efficiency where it helps, but maintaining that human pride in the core courier work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I've covered everything. I don't know about all my others coworkers experience using AI to help with tasks, but that's about all I can say at this point/

AI: Perfect, that's completely understandable. You've given us a really rich picture of how AI fits into your work environment - from the practical day-to-day uses to the deeper cultural considerations that shape how your company approaches these tools.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency with company values, and the thoughtful way you approach adding that human touch to AI-generated content, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
