Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, I am ready to begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a manager for a social media content creator and my work has me reaching out to brands and official representatives concerning collaborations and campaigns. I often use AI to find information and draft emails in a professional tone. I also use it to get advice on industry standards and current market values.

AI: That sounds like AI is helping you with some really key aspects of your role. When you mention drafting emails in a professional tone, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? Do you give the AI specific information about the brand or collaboration, or how does that usually work?

User: What usually happens is I will summarize that I received an email, explain the key components of what I would like to include in my response, and then provide the original email I received for context. Once I have a draft, I will either collaborate with the model to make edits such as making the draft more succinct, or I will take what it has given me and make my own edits before sending it to the client.

AI: That's a really interesting workflow you've developed. I'm curious about that decision point you mentioned - sometimes you collaborate with the model to make edits, and other times you take the draft and edit it yourself. What determines which approach you choose in the moment?

User: The biggest thing is preference and who the client is. Sometimes I deal with international clients who may not speak English well or even may just be translating all of their emails directly, so sometimes I will ask to make language simpler. Sometimes, I realize I missed something in the original prompt, so I will ask the model to add the new components into the email. Other times, the draft is close to something I would say and so I only need to make small edits before sending. It really depends on a lot of factors.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're really tailoring your approach based on the specific situation and client needs. You mentioned that sometimes the draft is close to something you would say. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I like how much time AI saves me in typing and brainstorming ideas, but I know it makes mistakes. I like to collaborate with AI, but I don't fully trust them to not make mistakes, so I end up handling and facilitating most tasks. I don't have any tasks I can think of that I would explicitly never use AI to help with. The closest thing I could think of would be in legal matters such as contracts and deliverables, I would rather consult an expert than rely on AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as a collaborative tool while maintaining that final oversight. You mentioned not fully trusting AI to avoid mistakes. Can you tell me more about what kinds of mistakes you've noticed or are particularly concerned about when using AI in your work?

User: Recently, I had a client in Italy and I wanted to propose a meeting that would be at 9AM EST, which would be 3PM their time. I didn't explicitly tell the model this and asked the model to draft a response. The draft incorrectly stated the meeting would be 9AM EST and 4PM their time. It's a simple mistake, but it could cause confusion and strain relationships with clients. Most of the time, the mistakes are small, but I have used and tested several models so I know even things that look correct may use unreliable sources, cite misinformation, or just be made up completely.

AI: That's a perfect example of how even small mistakes can have real consequences for client relationships. It sounds like your experience across different models has given you a pretty clear sense of their limitations. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others in your field approach it similarly, or have you noticed different attitudes?

User: I have seen AI used regularly in my field from fellow managers and content creators and clients alike. The biggest thing I have learned from good and bad examples around me is to always edit drafts to sound like something you would say and don't just copy/paste. I received an email yesterday that had the hallmarks of ChatGPT, such as using excessive em dashes, the rule of threes, and following a specific pattern of speech and writing. It comes off as unprofessional and a little tacky, so I always make sure to take any draft and make it my own. I never want to use AI as a way out of work from myself, but I want to use it as a tool to help me focus my thoughts and make my work easier.

AI: That's such a valuable insight about making drafts your own voice - and it sounds like receiving that obviously AI-generated email really reinforced why that matters. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was assessing market values for creative collaborations two weeks ago. I was giving past rates and entering in metrics to gauge if my creators were getting paid fairly for what they were offering. I received not only analysis, but also insight into sources I likely would not have found otherwise to compare and find that my creators should be getting more. I was very satisfied in how information was prepared, how the model took additional input and critiques, and how I was able to gain bargaining value and negotiation ideas from my research.

AI: That sounds like a really powerful example of AI helping you advocate for your creators - getting them better compensation they deserved. It's interesting how the AI not only analyzed what you gave it but also pointed you toward sources you might not have found on your own.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Again, I believe AI is a great tool to be used in conjunction with people instead of replacing people outright. Perhaps in the future AI will get so good at mimicking humans that they could replace many skills and jobs, but right now I believe maintaining skills in those areas is more important now than ever so that humanity does not become dependent on AI.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on maintaining that human element and avoiding dependency. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you use it, or do you think it will change around you?

User: AI is currently helping me grow my communication and negotiation skills, so as I improve in those areas I hope to change to be less dependent in those areas and learn new ways to interact. In a sense, once I have a better foundation, I hope to use more advanced techniques and ask more in-depth questions to grow even further.

AI: That's really interesting - you're seeing AI as almost like a training partner that's helping you build foundational skills, with the goal of eventually using it for more sophisticated work as you develop. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborative tool rather than a replacement, and that concrete example about how it helped you research market values to advocate for better compensation for your creators.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: The only thing is for context, the model I use most often it ChatGPT's GPT5. Hope that helps understand my answers a little better!

AI: That's actually really helpful context - thank you for sharing that! It definitely adds useful perspective to everything you've described about your workflow and experiences.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative tool, the importance of maintaining your own voice in communications, and how you're using it to build skills while staying aware of its limitations will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
