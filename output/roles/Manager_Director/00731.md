Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Hi Claude, no thats all good, I'm ready to begine

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: My role is a Operations manager, where I line manage 8 team leaders, who in turn manage staff who complete the work. For me I have 2 main uses for AI
1) I use the advanced Microsoft Copilot license (the one thats integrated into the Office 365 desktop apps) alot, I use it during MS Teams meetings to transcribe meeting notes, as well as review the summary of actions it makes, and who raised what point - this saves me time after a meeting. I use the copilot chat to help me craft macros for excel, as well as using copilot within excel to analyse some sets of data, and I use it within Outlook and word to help me draft emails, and the starting points of any documents I am writing.
2) I also use AI with client systems, I can't go into specific detail due to GDPR and PII etc, but we have identified processes that staff members would complete, that are highly repetitive, and often follow a very defined set of business rules/processes. We are working on a automated AI solution to work these items instead, freeing up staff time for more complex tasks

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like you're using AI in two quite different ways. 

I'm particularly interested in that first area with Microsoft Copilot. When you're using it for things like drafting emails or documents, how do you typically work with it? Do you tend to give it a complete task to handle, or do you find yourself going back and forth with it as you refine what you need?

User: It depends! For a short email, such as a confirmation reply to say I'm happy with a report sent to me, or a email from my team about staff performance and I just want to communicate a "good job, well done" type of message, I would ask Copilot to draft the whole email for me, I would give it a very quick glance and I would click send without checking all of it. Before that, I would spend 2-3 min's typing such an email out and I would often need to complete 2-3 emails per manager per day, which could be from 16-24, which if you consider that as a time saving, that's 32-48 minutes saved.
For more complex emails I will ask it to draft me a structure, but I would then review, this does save me some time, but it also gives me the added benefit it prevents me forgetting a key point, which prevents follow up
I also use copilot to draft comments for employee feedback, often with a prompt like "EMPLOYEE NAME has just done this task to a high standard. Please write me 2 paragraphs of text, I have included the company values below. Please ask me up to 4 questions to clarify specific points, to ensure the feedback is in line with 1 of the values. INSERT COMPANY VALUES" I find by asking Copilot to ask me questions about key points it feels are relevant, I get a far better level of feedback, than in turn can support the employee in their end of year review.
I also use it to help with 121 comments but I often ask it to review the text in word and ask it to make suggestions on improvements, than have it create the content from scratch, as I want to "own" this content for now still

AI: That's fascinating - I can really see how you've thought strategically about when to fully delegate versus when to collaborate. 

You mentioned wanting to "own" the content for your 121 comments. Tell me more about that. What makes those situations different from the routine confirmation emails where you're comfortable sending without much review?

User: My team have figured out when I'm using copilot in emails, and sometimes as a joke they will reply back to me with emails like "Thanks copilot" rather than "Thanks [REDACTED]" so while Copilot does a great job, my team can identify when a email I sent has been drafted by copilot, rather than myself.
Due to this, I still want to "Own" their 121's, if the team can spot the use of AI on a short email, I don't want the team to feel I don't value their time, so I choose to write their 121 comments and have copilot review them and make suggestions, rather than ask copilot to draft the comments, or make amendments automatically. 
I guess as I also have the 121 meeting via a teams video call, make notes, then type up the 121, I need to be sure that what I say in the meeting matches what I say in the notes, and it comes across in my style of language, and as it stands currently I feel that copilot is almost to effective in writing content, to the expense it will do a perfect job, while I as a human do make mistakes, or not write things out in "proper English", but my team know that its me writing it, and I need to have the respect and confidence of my team

AI: That's a really insightful observation about your team recognizing when you've used Copilot. It sounds like there's this balance you're managing between efficiency and authenticity in your communication.

Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones where you're comfortable using AI?

User: As you summarised, I do manage the balance between efficiency and authenticity when it comes to management discussions with my team. I use AI in lots of ways during the day, due to the nature of the work I get hourly reports, so I have a Copilot prompt for Excel that will calculate for me if there is a risk the staff wont complete the amount of work required, and would mean we breach our SLA in terms of working an item with the correct average handling time. 
I typically use AI for more tasks where the outcome can be very defined - eg will we complete the work on time, on what days has a specific staff member not achieved target, such as data analysis, where both AI and myself would get to the same answer. But where the answer to the prompt could be more subjective, or it involves more than 3 paragraphs of written content, I would take on the task myself.
A short answer to your question is I favor AI when the answer is Yes/no, or a specific numerical answer based on analysis of a excel sheet, summarisation of a meeting transcript of email and creating written content of up to 3 paragraphs, and for anything over 3 paragraphs I would rather own the content, but use copilot to make sure I have not missed anything.

AI: That's a really clear framework - using AI when the outcome is more defined versus keeping ownership when things get more subjective or longer-form.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has their approach affected how you think about using these tools?

User: Yes, there was a staggered roll out of the copilot 365 licenses, with upper management having them first, then my level, so I was able to see the benefits of how others used it - the transcription of meetings and the copilot produced summary is a very popular feature a lot of my colleagues use.
When I see my team using AI, I do take note, as I want to ensure they are sharing what works well, and what could be improved, to make sure everyone benefits from it. I have had to do some training in prompt structuring to enable them to get the most out of it

AI: It sounds like you've become something of an AI mentor for your team. You mentioned having to do training on prompt structuring - what kinds of challenges were they running into that made you realize they needed that guidance?

User: They were not going into sufficient detail, and treating it like how someone would interact with a AI chatbot for the first time with short prompts, often with a degree of nonsense to create a fun output. I'll go back to my feedback example I mentioned earlier, I always get a far better feedback comments if I ask copilot to draft feedback in line with the company values, which I include with the prompt, and ask copilot to ask me some questions to allow it to fine tune its response, and for copilot to extract information from me. My team members were just giving prompts like "please give me feedback for EMPLOYEE because they did a good job" which meant they were not getting as strong of a response. 
I have had to educate my team that they need to put effort into a good prompt to get a good response, as copilot will attempt to always respond with the answer, irrespective of how much detail its given.

AI: That makes perfect sense - it's interesting how the quality of input really determines the quality of output. You've clearly developed quite sophisticated prompting strategies.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think when we first got access to the copilot 365 license, and I was experimenting with it in Excel and used the deeper analysis of data mode it has, and I asked it to analyse the past 3 months of incoming work volume, and it identified trends, and highlighted the days we received more incoming work, which was Wednesdays. As a result of this, we actually reduced the amount of offline time (staff 121's, training, etc) spent on a Wednesday to enable this work to be cleared through more effective, and put more offline time in on Monday, and this has meant we have had a more stable amount of work in our queues at the end of each day, something that only came about with me experimenting on what Copilot could do

AI: That's such a great example of AI revealing patterns that led to real operational improvements. It sounds like that discovery moment really opened your eyes to what was possible.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think AI could fully take over my role, yet, while its come on in a long way, due to the nature of the work we receive, and that some items require a degree of mitigation when it comes to decision making, I'm not concerned about AI taking over.
I do keep my skills up to date, I often read social media such as dedicated Reddit subs on the use of AI in the work place, to find how others do it to see if I can make my work any more effective. I feel my position is secure as I'm trying to stay on top of how AI is used in the workplace

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - staying ahead of the curve rather than worrying about being replaced by it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you?

User: I can see it evolving to take on more small tasks, freeing up both my time, and the time of my teams, to focus on the more complex areas of work. I do see it helping to reduce headcount over time in some areas, but potentially it could open us up to more work so I just see it as a evolution of how we work.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on balancing efficiency with authenticity in your team communications, and how you've developed such strategic thinking about when to collaborate versus when to delegate tasks to AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so, thank you for the questions and feedback

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about prompt engineering, team dynamics, and finding that balance between AI efficiency and personal authenticity will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been great talking with you today!
