Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: that sounds great! let's begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: usually I would use AI to edit and format daily reports and write ups, research best methods for dealing with issues with clients and patients or just brainstorm new ideas, new approaches

AI: That's helpful context. It sounds like you're working in a field that involves both client and patient interactions, which suggests healthcare or a related service field.

When you mention using AI to research best methods for dealing with issues - could you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? How do you approach that kind of research task with AI?

User: for example, last time i was working with a client, they shared some concerns about how to deal with their diabetes and how that would affect their daily life and mental health. I asked ChatGPT how people in this situation usually deals with these challenges and i adapted the response to my client's needs and shared that with them. It mostly confirmed what I had in mind but helped me articulate it clearly and approach it from a more objective perspective. For research, it is pretty similar. Instead of searching google scholar for general studies, it helped me refine my research instantly based on my particular needs.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI is serving as both a validation tool for your existing knowledge and helping you communicate more effectively with clients.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Not really no, the only tasks that AI could help with that I don't use it for would be ones that are too sensitive to blindly trust the AI with. I would always, for example, verify that the information provided by the AI exists in the article that it finds for me.

AI: That makes sense - you're maintaining that critical oversight role. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I usually collaborate with it throughout. Even when using it to edit or format my write ups and daily reports, I always double check at the end that it followed the requirements, but more often, I use it for specific parts of the task rather than asking it to write the report entirely.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like it gives you a lot of control over the process. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not at all, I think i am much more flexible in my use of AI than my colleagues or workplace. I have in fact been asked not to use it by a supervisor who simply do not trust AI as a tool. I have however continued to use it, more sparingly, and in such a way that my supervisor has not been able to detect.

AI: That's a really interesting dynamic - it sounds like there's some tension between your personal experience with AI's usefulness and institutional concerns about it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure, last time I had to write an observation report of my interaction with a patient, I used the speech mode on chatgpt to just think out loud about all my observations, rambling a bit, and at the end asked it to format it as i've explained to it before and it was able to instantly format and edit the text document to the requirements of my institution. saving precious time.

AI: That sounds like a really smooth workflow - using the speech mode to capture your thoughts and then having it structured automatically. That must have felt quite efficient.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: not really no, I would welcome being replaced in tasks that AI could do better if it means freeing more time for me to apply myself to tasks that AI cannot assist with. In my work, there is extensive patient facing duties that AI would not be able to take over in any meaningful way, at least not in the near future.

AI: That's a pragmatic way to look at it - focusing on the uniquely human aspects of your work while letting AI handle the more routine tasks.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope that it becomes more normalised to have AI assist in daily duties as i've outlined previously. Currently, the only friction in my relationship with AI comes from colleagues that do not see the benefits or have irrational concerns.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you use AI as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement, and how you're navigating the workplace dynamics around AI acceptance.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: maybe just a point regarding the frictions i've mentioned. I wonder if it's linked to my area of work, but if AI tools were integrated at the institutional level, it could indeed replace certain human roles, but it would also make a lot of my work more efficient. I explained in the previous part of the interview task that I deal with many teams of workers, working with many different patients. Often, the observations recorded by team members are lost in a sea of information that each subsequent worker has to parse through. Having an AI assistant able to review all the information recorded and disseminate it to the right people, the right teams, would save time and avoid risks of missing key information.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - you're highlighting how AI could serve not just individual efficiency but also improve information flow and coordination across teams. The idea of AI helping to surface and route critical patient information to the right people at the right time could have significant safety and care quality implications.

It sounds like there's a gap between what's possible with AI integration at an organizational level versus the current resistance you're experiencing from leadership. That institutional versus individual adoption tension seems like an important dynamic.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about both the practical applications of AI in patient care settings and the organizational challenges around adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
