Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it predominantly for help writing emails and to answer just basic questions I have. I will sometimes use it for personal questions as well.

AI: That's helpful. When you mention using it for basic questions - can you give me some examples of the types of questions you typically ask?

User: Oh, there are so many. I'll ask for help calculating a student's grade or current events I need to share with students. For example, we read a book called Where the Red Fern Grows. I like to show students the difference in cost of living by comparing prices then and now. I use AI to look up current prices.

AI: That's a great example - using it to make historical context more relatable for your students. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes. I find that using AI to find images is too slow if you don't have a paid subscription. I will image search on my own.

AI: That makes sense - efficiency is important when you're preparing for class.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I will often give it the gist of what I'm thinking and then ask for suggestions based on that.

AI: Tell me more about that process. When you give it the gist of your thinking and ask for suggestions, what happens next? Do you go back and forth refining the ideas together, or do you typically take its suggestions and run with them?

User: For example, for an email. I don't just say write an email. I write it and then I ask AI to spruce it up a bit. I tell what tone I'm wanting to convey. This way the email comes across to the recipient in the way I intend.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - maintaining your voice while getting help with tone. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My principal (boss) is all for using AI in appropriate ways. He is pro for using it to help make our work easier.

AI: That sounds like a supportive environment. Has your principal or your colleagues shared any specific guidance about what they consider "appropriate ways" to use AI? Or have you had conversations with other teachers about how they're using it?

User: He never really gave inappropriate examples. I think he just means using common sense on the ethics of what you're doing. That's how I took in anyway. Other teachers really don't talk about their usage of it. I figure they are using it, but since it is so taboo for students to use it to complete work, I think a lot of teachers feel like hypocrites for using it themselves.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the tension teachers might feel. It sounds like there's an interesting dynamic there.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Just yesterday, actually. I was trying to ask AI if there was an online calculator that would quickly give me a list of grades when you do raw scores instead of each question having the same amount of points. It kept directing me to either and EZ grader, which is not what I want, or a regular calculator to do percents. None of that is what I was looking for. I don't know if I explained it wrong or it just isn't' out there.

AI: That sounds frustrating - when you know exactly what you need but can't seem to get AI to understand the specific tool you're looking for. 

Can you tell me more about what you were actually trying to accomplish? It sounds like you had a particular grading scenario in mind that these suggested tools couldn't handle?

User: I have decided to grade out of points. Instead of saying each paper is worth 100 points, I wanted to do different points per item. Example, paper is worth 50 points, student got 45 out of 50. What would the grade be? I know how to figure it out on a calculator. I just wanted something to have it in a quick chart I could just look at.

AI: Ah, I see - you wanted a quick reference chart for weighted scoring where different assignments have different point values. That makes perfect sense for efficiency.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I really don't worry about that. After Covid and the closing of schools, the general public don't want a computer teaching their kids. I do think other jobs are in jeopardy, but not teaching. I hope I'm right.

AI: That's an interesting perspective about the human connection being irreplaceable in teaching, especially after the pandemic experience.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope I don't get too reliant on it. It has made email writing and other correspondence so incredibly easy. I don't want to stop using my brain. It wouldn't be awful if I could upload assignments for it to grade. Ones that have open-ended answers, not just objective ones.

AI: That's a thoughtful balance you're considering - appreciating the efficiency while wanting to stay mentally engaged. The idea of AI grading open-ended responses is intriguing.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the tension teachers might feel about using AI themselves while restricting student use, and your awareness of wanting to maintain that balance between efficiency and keeping your own skills sharp.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I'm good.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a teaching tool - from making historical context more relatable to helping craft the right tone in communications - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated your candid thoughts about the challenges and the thoughtful way you're approaching this technology. Take care!

User: You too!

AI: Thank you! Have a great rest of your day, and best of luck with your students and that grading chart challenge!
