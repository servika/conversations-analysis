Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, we can begin

AI: Great, let's dive in. Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a dance teacher so I definitely don't use AI everyday at work.  One way I have been trying to use it,  is to quickly create a basic structure for a class lesson plan that I then fill in with my own exercises/song choices.  So for example, I ask it to make the outline of a lesson plan for a 30 minute pre-pointe class that includes 5 minutes of strengthening exercises on the floor, 20 minutes of barrework, and 5 minutes of stretching.  Then I fill in each section with the exercises I want.  I also use AI to check the grammar/spelling/flow of things I need to write, like my artistic bio or the synopsis for a ballet

AI: That's fascinating - using AI as a structural foundation that you then customize with your expertise. When you have AI create those lesson plan outlines, how detailed does it get, and how much do you typically end up changing or adding to what it gives you?

User: So, at first the LLM would try to write the exercises for me, but I really didn't like that (it doesn't know my students!).  So now it's more or less designing the document for me; formatting the text for different headings, setting up bullet points for exercises etc.  The basic structure is usually ok, though I tend to go back and forth a few rounds to perfect it.  (For example, it offered me a really formal lesson plans with objectives, learning summaries etc, which could be useful if I were writing a curriculum for the school or showing my lesson plan to other people. But since the lesson plan is just for me, I prefer a pared down version that just helps me stay organized in the classroom).

AI: That's a really clear example of you steering the collaboration to match your needs. Tell me more about that back-and-forth process you mentioned - what does it typically look like when you're refining the structure with AI to get it just right for your personal use?

User: I think the back and forth happens because my initial prompt might be lacking in detail. So the LLM might be showing me a perfectly fine lesson plan, but then I realize I want a place to list the album/track of the music I'll be using for each exercise, or that I'd like the date added under the title or something like that.

AI: I see - so you're discovering what you actually need as you see the first version. That makes a lot of sense. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you really didn't like it trying to write the actual exercises for you. Are there other tasks in your work where you prefer to handle things yourself, even though AI could potentially help?

User: Yes, I'm really hesitant to trust the AI to develop progressions of exercises, to do anything creative (like offer choreography suggestions), or to teach me something about a topic I'm not confident in.  Like, I don't think I could trust an AI with a question like, "My students are having trouble keeping their alignment when doing grande plies. What are some strengthening exercises I can include in class to address this?"  I would much rather ask other dance teachers or look for articles or videos by experts online.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you draw a clear line between structural tasks versus the expertise-based content. When you say you wouldn't trust AI with that alignment question, what specifically concerns you about relying on it for that kind of technical advice?

User: Alignment issues can verge on medical territory...  sometimes students might even need to seek out a physical therapist or doctor (i.e. if they have scoliosis). I don't want to present medical type advice, especially if it's wrong, because this could be really damaging to students. Since I'm not a medical doctor, I don't feel qualified to judge the AI's output on this since I wouldn't know if it's confabulating something or misleading me

AI: That makes complete sense - you're being thoughtful about the potential consequences when you can't verify the accuracy yourself. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other dance teachers you know use it differently, or is there much conversation about it in your field?

User: I don't think there's much conversation about it.  In general, I've only know other people to use it to help polish their bios or clean up text for programs, websites, etc

AI: So it sounds like most dance teachers are using it for similar text-related tasks rather than for the more technical aspects of teaching. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Honestly, I've not had an experience where I felt really strongly.  When I used it to help write a synopsis of a new ballet based on notes I gave it, it was a little frustrating.  I needed to ask for multiple re-writes because the text was overly flowery and it added details that weren't in the notes.  Still, it wasn't so bad.

AI: That's helpful to know - sounds like it was more of a minor inconvenience than a major frustration. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not to worried about AI dance teachers!! I think that even if we get to the point that you can have an AI generated avatar teaching ballet to people over the internet, that a lot of people would still want to take class with real humans.  There's definitely a social aspect to class, and also it's hard to give physical corrections over the internet.  I'm having trouble picturing people wanting to take a ballet class with a robot dance teacher too...so I really don't feel too concerned

AI: That confidence really comes through - the human and social elements seem pretty central to what you do. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll expand how you use it, or do you expect it to stay pretty much in the same lane?

User: I could see myself using it more with my lesson planning/curriculum design.  So maybe I could use it to keep track of the various lesson plans I've written and have it pull up exercises/plans from previous years.  I'd like to be able to use it to do some fun stuff like suggest a themed playlist for a ballet class and put it together based off my music library.  But all in all, I see it mostly as a helper for writing/editing/organizing.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on drawing clear boundaries between structural help and the expertise that requires human judgment, especially when it comes to student safety.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, I think that's about it

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've found ways to use AI as a structural tool while maintaining clear boundaries around your professional expertise will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
