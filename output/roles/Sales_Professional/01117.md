Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No,  I think I am ready to begin with whatever questions you have for me

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: So my creative niche is I create 3D printed tokens for card games, most typically Magic: The Gathering, using a program called HueForge to take a 2D design and give it depth, scale, and colour. A typical project is starting with a need for a token/card design - be it from client, or for general sales - and working through creating a drawing, photoshopping it to be set for HueForge, and then colour mapping in HueForge to create an STL, a 3D object, that is then ready to be 3D printed

AI: That's fascinating - I love how you're bridging digital art and physical manufacturing. The process from 2D concept to 3D printed object sounds quite intricate.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: The main use for AI I have gleamed from my process is the ability to rapidly create 2D renderings/ideas for token genres. I will typically create a "line", like a series, of tokens that follow the same aesthetical style and I have created in Gemini a variety of system prompts, like one for generating prompts of aesthetical styles, and one for generating images from those prompts that meets the typical standards and aesthetics of a token that I need. So as of now, it is mostly in the ideation portion of my creative process.

AI: That's really interesting - you've essentially created your own AI workflow system with those custom prompts in Gemini. It sounds like you're using AI as a creative springboard for generating ideas and visual concepts.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as the creator?

User: Take for example my latest series, "The Rising Sun" - AI assisted in the ability to quickly create prototypes of each [REDACTED] the speed from which I have a 2D image that I can then take through the workflow to make 3D. In most ways, AI functions as an efficiency tool, speeding up the first "third" of the workflow if you will, the prototyping portion mostly. It feels nice to be able to quickly get from an idea to a physical product within two hours say.

AI: That's a dramatic time compression - going from idea to physical product in two hours is impressive! It sounds like AI is acting as a powerful accelerator in that initial creative phase.

When you're working with AI during that prototyping portion, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions - are you directing the AI, or does it surprise you with ideas you hadn't considered?

User: Rarely have I found the AI particularly to be "creative" if you will, specifically as I am not sure I could say that the system prompt's I have written allow it to exist outside of typical artistic norms. I would say I have almost exclusively been directing it, and found that to be the number one pain point in terms of my direction being lost from say prompt to image generation or image editing.

AI: That's a really insightful observation - that the AI stays within conventional artistic boundaries and that maintaining your creative direction through the process can be challenging. It sounds like you're very much the creative driver, but the translation of your vision can get lost along the way.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this prototyping phase?

User: I think AI has allowed for a person like me, who is not adept nor willing nor wanting to draw, to be able to actually create something that very few others are actually creating. It has allowed me to exist as a creator, making prototypes to prove the concept from which we can then allow for an actual artist to take creative control from there to create a product that has IP and legal protection.

AI: That's a profound insight - AI essentially opened up a new creative pathway for you, allowing you to participate in visual creation despite not being drawn to traditional drawing. You've found a way to be a creator and conceptual developer even when that's not your natural skill set.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: The concern I would have is that the ability to automate the artistic process, like a 2D drawing, makes it so easy that it could broadly disincentivizes other artists from entering the field growing up. The ability to make truly creative decisions is at this moment, still largely a human ability, and I feel like as the years go bye, and the ability to generate what are at their core standard artistic pieces - following the rules and logic that artistic theory presents - creates a scenario where unique and special talents are not going to enter the field as they see it is saturated or a waste of time.

AI: That's a really thoughtful concern about the long-term ecosystem effects - the idea that AI could potentially discourage the development of truly unique artistic voices who might otherwise push creative boundaries beyond conventional rules.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate it expanding beyond that initial prototyping phase, or do you see it staying in that specific niche?

User: I could easily see it expanding into the photo editing aspect of the my workflow, and frankly would appreciate if it was better at that as the typical photoshop tasks I have are color editing jobs that frankly can take a pain staking amount of time to individually color in sections that I feel like AI could be well suited for. Do I think it could expand into the other portions of my workflow beyond that? Sure, but I am not sure that functionality is important enough for developers to want to engage with it.

AI: That makes perfect sense - automating those tedious color editing tasks would be a natural next step that could save you significant time. It's interesting that you see the market demand question as a limiting factor for AI development in the more specialized parts of your workflow.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has opened up creative pathways for people who aren't traditional artists, and your nuanced concern about the potential long-term impact on artistic talent development.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I think that's about it, thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as an enabler for non-traditional artists, the challenges of maintaining creative direction through AI tools, and your thoughtful perspective on the broader implications for the creative field will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you discussed both the empowering aspects of AI in your workflow and your genuine concerns about its long-term effects on artistic development. Best of luck with "The Rising Sun" series and your future token projects!
