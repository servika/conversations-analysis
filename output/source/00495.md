Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope no questions. Let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to help me write session notes for insurance. I also use it for ideation. For example, some programs are "The client will answer 25 WH questions with adjectives." I will have the model help me come up with 25 questions that I can run

AI: That's really helpful to understand. When you're using AI to help generate those 25 WH questions, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: I pick a model, usually ChatGPT or Gemini, and ask it to generate 25 questions. Normally, the questions aren't that good and I have to edit them. I'll try and provide an example if I have one.

AI: Tell me more about what makes the questions "not that good" when they first come back. What specifically do you find yourself having to edit?

User: Well we work in a clinic and frequently the questions don't make sense in a clinical setting or aren't generalizable across clients. For example, I asked Gemini to "Give me a list of 5-10 verb adverb combos with an associated image." The model generated "**Drive carefully:** You should drive **carefully** on the wet roads" and "**Sing beautifully:** She sang **beautifully**, captivating the entire audience." There was no image and "driving carefully" would be unreasonable to demonstrate with an image. Sometimes the questions are like "What color is your bed?" but I don't know the color of the client's bed so that's not something that I could use

AI: That's a really clear example of the disconnect between what AI generates and what's actually practical in your setting. When you're editing these questions to make them work for your clients, what are you typically changing them to? How do you make them more clinically appropriate?

User: Frequently, I just ask the model to give me another list and see if it can come up with something relevant. Otherwise, I just think of things relevant for our clinic and what it offers. Or I make them more vague. Instead of saying "What's in your room? (A Barbie Dreamhouse)" I'll change the answer too "A bed."

AI: So you're doing quite a bit of back-and-forth with the model to get something usable. When you think about this process of generating questions versus doing it completely yourself from scratch, what draws you to using AI for this task despite needing to do all that editing?

User: Because 25 questions is a lot and if I can get 15 usable ones then I only have to generate 10. Normally I can get around like 15, edit the model to get another 5, and then just use my brain for the last 5. Sometimes the model is way worse. Sometimes it's better. But that's one target. Normally, there's more than one so I'd have to think of 100s of questions, but I don't. And if the model can generate an image when I need it that's wayyyyy faster than drawing it or finding something

AI: That makes a lot of sense - even with the editing, you're still cutting down your workload significantly. You mentioned session notes for insurance as another use. How does your approach differ when you're using AI for that task compared to generating the questions?

User: With the session notes they NEED to be written a specific way so normally I give the model what I have written and ask it to add a sentence or make the note more formal. Overall, however, the model is not good at this and I almost always have to ask it to rewrite or change something

AI: You've mentioned that the model "is not good at this" for session notes and needs frequent rewrites. Given that challenge, what keeps you using AI for the session notes rather than just writing them yourself from the start?

User: I am slowly giving up on the AI and just writing them myself. However, I am trying new ways to maybe get a more usable note. That would cut down on the amount of time I spend writing significantly

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: A lot of my tasks are hands on. AI can't help with them. If a task is fun and fulfilling I don't see the value in asking AI. It might save time, but I'd rather enjoy my work than save time

AI: That's a really interesting perspective - prioritizing enjoyment over efficiency. Can you tell me more about what makes certain work tasks feel fun and fulfilling to you?

User: I guess what makes them fun and fulfilling is that I like doing them. If I don't like doing the task I ask AI.

AI: That's a pretty straightforward approach. When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: If I could delegate it I would, but the models aren't providing me the results I need so it's a collaborative approach

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: They haven't really. I know some people use ChatGPT for their notes, but the workplace is pretty nuetral

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When I was trying to get it to write my note and it kept doing things in a completely nonsensical way so I kept having to get the model to rewrite it then gave up and did it myself. Alternatively, recently the model managed to write the note basically perfect on the first try so that was mean

AI: That recent time when the model got the note basically perfect on the first try - what do you think was different about that situation? Was it something about how you prompted it, or the type of note, or just luck?

User: Normally I have things written and ask the model to rewrite or add sentences. I might give it ideas for what it can add. That time I gave it basically bullet points of things that it converted into sentences and that pretty much worked

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yeah for sure. It does seem kinda pointless to maintain skills that will most likely become obsolete. When thinking about going back to school I worry that some career options won't still exist in 10 years and then all the schooling will be pointless

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Hopefully it writes better notes and does the boring administrative tasks., the things that feel like "busy work"

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on preferring to keep the enjoyable tasks for yourself rather than optimizing purely for efficiency.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI in a clinical setting - the back-and-forth editing process, the tension between efficiency and job satisfaction, and your pragmatic approach to which tasks to delegate - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
