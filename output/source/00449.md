Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for product photo editing, social media post generation, creating promotional materials, general research, and as a replacement for search engines.

AI: That's quite a range of applications! It sounds like AI has become integrated across multiple aspects of your work.

Can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like when you're using AI for one of these tasks? For instance, when you're working on product photo editing or creating promotional materials?

User: Usually for promoting a product, I'll just take a simple photo on my my phone, it's not the best quality. I used to use image generation models just to stylize and create my own backgrounds and such, but now I use Nano-Banana and other models on LMArena to do very curated edits that imitate product photography.

AI: That's fascinating - so you've moved from more general image generation to using specific models that can do precise product photography edits. 

Tell me more about that shift. What drove you to move away from creating your own backgrounds to using these more curated editing approaches?

User: I immediately knew the application after the release of Nano-Banana, and some of the Seededit generations on LMArena. I knew that it would be able to mimic photography as long as I isolate the subject, and it works really good! It has already crossed the barrier of interpreting text consistently in a scene.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you recognized the potential right away when these new capabilities emerged. The fact that it can handle text consistently in scenes seems like a significant breakthrough for your work.

When you say it "works really good," what does success look like for you? How do you judge whether the AI-generated product photos meet your standards compared to traditional photography?

User: When it takes a close analysis of a 4k resolution photo to see the artifacts, that's when it crossed my personal threshold to "Yeah, nobody looking at a product photo will notice or care about that."

AI: That's a very practical threshold - when the artifacts are only visible under close scrutiny, it becomes commercially viable for your purposes.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There isn't really any task that couldn't be boosted by some assistance, whether I learn a new method or more information. Though doing the action itself for some practices I still prefer, such as writing. For writing I'll get assistance with word choice and structure but I don't want to lose my voice, it would be like letting an AI assistant with audio modality speak for me.

AI: That's a thoughtful distinction - you're drawing a line between getting assistance to enhance your own work versus having AI replace your voice entirely. 

Can you tell me more about how you maintain your voice when you're getting help with word choice and structure? What does that collaboration look like in practice?

User: I get multiple iterations or advice on what a sentence structure might look better as, and same with word choice, and then I select the one that gives me an "Aha!" reaction.

AI: That "Aha!" reaction as your selection criteria is really insightful - it sounds like you're using that as a way to recognize when something truly resonates with your own voice.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Always a collaboration; I feel like I'm searching for a good balance of human input and expression alongside LLM assistance.

AI: That balance you're seeking sounds like an ongoing process. 

Can you describe what that collaboration looks like day-to-day? How do you typically divide the work between yourself and the AI - who does what in this partnership you've developed?

User: It's very iterative and based on ideation. I work with it back-and-forth, as a director almost. Sometimes the LLM continues to just present ideas until I have one that sparks something in me, then I commit and run with it. Sometimes I have a full vision before the work begins and I direct it iteratively in that direction.

AI: That director-collaborator dynamic is really compelling - it sounds like you shift between being more exploratory versus more directive depending on how formed your vision is at the start.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has the environment you work in shaped how you approach these tools?

User: Not at all, I work in retail. They do not understand LLMs and very rarely use them, they use them sometimes instead of Google. Thankfully, I have a lot of freedom in my day to do general marketing and design promotional materials, so I can experiment on my own.

AI: That's interesting - so you're essentially pioneering this approach in your workplace environment. Having that freedom to experiment without much oversight or input from colleagues seems to have given you space to develop your own methods.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Most often it's frustrating when I do have a very clear vision in my head but I realize that there is some sort of limitation preventing it from coming to fruition. So, some ideas have to be shelved. For satisfied, it's when I realize the technology is real, and things are changing. The release of Veo 3, and recently doing perfect "product photography" simply by isolating the products, were huge wake up calls that it has already changed things.

AI: Those moments of technological breakthrough sound almost surreal - recognizing that something you might have considered impossible is suddenly achievable. 

When you have to shelve ideas because of current limitations, do you find yourself keeping track of those for future possibilities, or do you typically move on to what's feasible right now?

User: I do keep them on the backburner. I have a note that I am keeping ideas, even if the limitations prevent it from being possible. I move on to creating the thing that is currently possible.

AI: That's smart - keeping that running list of possibilities while staying focused on what you can accomplish today.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: My main skill was cooking and my career was bartending, so I think from this point forward it'll just improve all of my other skills. I don't believe it will "take over" human art and expression.

AI: That's a really interesting perspective - coming from hands-on, craft-based work like cooking and bartending seems to give you a different lens on AI's role.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this partnership heading?

User: I actually see it catapulting me into an entirely new direction and changing my life and career goals. I was disenchanted with bartending and left it, and I have always been wanting to get into tech somehow. I think that LLMs are giving me that ability, without a formal education.

AI: That's a remarkable transformation - AI isn't just changing how you do your current work, but potentially opening up an entirely new career path for you. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining your voice in writing and how you're using AI as a bridge into tech without formal education.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Just that I quit my career, started budtending, and within a year I'm making expert-level promotional content for a multimillion dollar company that previously had an entire marketing team. Things are changing!

AI: Wow - that timeline is striking. Going from quitting bartending to producing expert-level marketing content for a multimillion dollar company in just a year really underscores the speed of change you're experiencing firsthand.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about this dramatic career shift and how you're pioneering AI use in a traditional retail environment will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
