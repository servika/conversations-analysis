Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Typically, I use AI for idea generation. I'm a high school teacher and I like to have engaging and active lessons. I turn to AI when I'm lesson planning to brainstorm ideas. Lesson planning happens sporadically and at different points in the day. I have a prep block every other day, so I might use it then, but often in the evenings or on the weekend, I'm looking at the week ahead or the next day and wondering what I can do to spice things up.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become part of your creative process for teaching. When you're in those moments of brainstorming for lessons, how do you typically interact with the AI? Are you bouncing ideas back and forth, or do you come with a specific request and let it generate options for you?

User: I find I have more success if I ask for a specific request. Then, from there, I can fine tune or shift the prompt if it's not giving me what I'm looking for.

AI: Tell me more about that fine-tuning process. What does it look like when the first response isn't quite hitting the mark?

User: So, for example, I might ask for ideas for a hook on a topic like political philosophy and the model tells me "Have quotes prepared to spark discussion," I'd like some examples of quotes so I don't have to go the extra step to find them on my own.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you want the AI to take you all the way to something actionable rather than giving you another task to complete. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There's no getting around the fact that I need to know the material I'm teaching well. So, I prefer to read content myself rather than rely on a summary. I also would rather draft a set of instructions for an assignment or criteria/rubrics on my own first and then get help with formatting maybe, rather than have to sort through and refine AI output.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction. It sounds like you want to maintain ownership over the core content knowledge and the foundational structure of your assignments. 

When you do use AI for tasks like lesson brainstorming or formatting help, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete request and let it handle that piece independently?

User: Conversations don't typically take more than 2 or 3 turns. So, usually a bit of back and forth, but not all that much.

AI: That's a pretty efficient workflow - getting what you need in just a few exchanges. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Some colleagues have no idea about AI and I find myself showing them things. Others exchange ideas with me, like lesson plans involving AI use with students or even using AI as an assessment tool, or like how a human can improve AI-produced creative writing, or how we can distinguish the two. However, we are on hold for using AI with our students right now as our school board works out some legal issues.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you're in this interesting position where some colleagues are learning from you, while others are collaborating and sharing ideas, but there's also this institutional uncertainty happening at the board level.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The absolute worst was when I was very ill and I thought I had reviewed an AI generated vocabulary worksheet and made corrections. I hadn't, and I gave it to the substitute anyway, not realizing it was riddled with errors. I felt so badly that everyone was thrown off and confused by it.

AI: That sounds like a really difficult situation - especially when you were already not feeling well. It must have been frustrating to have that kind of mistake happen when you were trying to be prepared for your students and the substitute.

On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied? What was happening there?

User: It was the end of first semester last year and I was surprised that my students were still energetic and engaged with classes (I teach grade 12s and they often become apathetic). I wanted to match that energy and I turned to AI for some ideas for review activities. I used two that were a big hit. One was a timeline of the course on the whiteboard, where students decorated and wrote their "Ah-ha" moment - which was cool to see, and there were other stations where I had all the major texts we read, and they left a sticky-note with what "stuck with them". I collected all the stickies after and it was really heart warming to see what their takeaways were from the materials. I never would have seen that otherwise, and I think the students enjoyed the activities.

AI: What a wonderful example - you could really feel the energy and connection in that moment. It sounds like the AI helped you create something that revealed insights about your students' learning that you might not have captured otherwise.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really. I'm a teacher in the HUMANities. Even though kids can take online courses if they want, they still enroll in classes with me. The experience of reading, writing, viewing, representing, speaking and listening (our curriculum) is very much tied to being in person together. Perhaps some of what I do could be addressed with AI, such as feedback on grammar or something like that, but these days, we focus so much on critical thinking, face to face skills and cooperative learning that I don't fear AI will be a match for what I do.

AI: That's a really confident and grounded perspective - the emphasis on those human-centered skills and the in-person experience seems like it gives you a clear sense of your irreplaceable role.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Once we sort the legality issue, I'm hoping my students can use AI to help them with their writing - not generate it, but help them brainstorm, organize, become more concise or develop their ideas. It's a tricky situation, because it is very tempting for them to use AI to just do the whole thing, but where is the learning in that? Most students I talk to want to improve their English and Philosophy skills (my subjects) anyhow. The models can't do the hard work, but they can certainly help along the way.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining ownership of the core knowledge while using AI as a creative partner for lesson planning, and your vision for how students might use AI as a learning aid rather than a replacement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I also work in the school library and teach resource evaluation. Some models are better than others at sourcing, but I think this is *crucial* for young people. They must learn how to question the source of information, so when AI just garbles it all and doesn't tell us where it's from, it creates a problem.

AI: That's such an important point - especially from your perspective teaching resource evaluation. The tension between AI's ability to synthesize information quickly and the critical need for students to understand sourcing and evaluate credibility seems like a really significant challenge you're navigating.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI as a creative tool while maintaining educational integrity, and the complexities of preparing students for a world with AI, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
