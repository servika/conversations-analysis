Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I don't have any questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to come up with ideas for social media content, write product description (I sell prints of my artwork), SEO, and general brainstorming when no one else is around. I try to keep it separate from my creative work.

AI: That's interesting that you keep it separate from your creative work. Can you tell me more about that distinction you make between using AI for business tasks versus your creative process?

User: Honestly, I don

AI: It sounds like you were starting to share something there - please go ahead and finish your thought. I'm listening.

User: Thanks. I accidentally hit enter. I was saying that I don't like the way AI is being used to generate images. A lot of artists have had their work scraped and used as training data without permission. Just recently, an artist I adore found out that someone has been taking portraits and running them through AI image generators to create real-life versions of it and posting them on pinterest.

AI: That sounds really concerning, especially as an artist yourself. How does that experience - both your own feelings about image generation and seeing what happened to the artist you admire - influence the way you think about using AI for the business side of your art practice?

User: I don't like it. I wouldn't care if they used like stock photos (with permission, there are plenty of free sites) or things in the public domain, but actively taking other artists' work without permission and compensation, then using their names to promote your image generation (e.g. We can make art like [insert name here]) turns me off. I've heard the argument that it helps disabled artists but that community is outraged that they're being used to take the humanity out of creativity. There are plenty of disabled artists who find ways to make it work for them. Not to mention people thinking they can type in a prompt, have an AI spit out an image and call themselves artists. It demeans an already undervalued profession. 

Like I said, I don't think I'd mind as much if it were ethically sourced and was pitched as a way for artists to like... use as reference or inspiration. Like if you had something in your head and you wanted to find a way to work it out, and no other online source has what you're looking for.

AI: You've laid out some really thoughtful distinctions there about ethical sourcing and how the technology could potentially be used differently. Given those strong feelings about image generation, how do you reconcile using text-based AI for your business tasks? Do you think about it differently, or does it create any internal tension for you?

User: I think it's different because it's administrative work. I take way too long to think of product descriptions, because I have to keep a ton of things in mind and I'm a perfectionist. It can take a long time. AI helps me cut through the noise and include the keywords I need. I tweak it as necessary. I do enjoy writing, but business writing is not my expertise, and I can't afford to hire anyone.

But I do feel tension about it, absolutely. The ethics can be tricky! We don't know enough about where it's being sourced. I've also heard environmental concerns. It's hard. You want to do the right thing.

AI: That tension you describe sounds really genuine - wanting to do the right thing while also having practical business needs as a solo artist. When you're in those moments where you're deciding whether to use AI for something like product descriptions, what goes through your mind? How do you work through that decision?

User: Honestly, I don't think about it much anymore. I use Shopify and it has something called Shopify Magic which helps write product descriptions. I tell it what I need it to say/include, pick the tone, and it generates accordingly. I edit and/or regenerate as needed. I used to feel bad about it, like I was betraying so many industries affected by AI (including writers!) but... I try to think of it more as a time-saving tool. I just wish there was more transparency. I honestly don't think people would care if they sourced things from the public domain. There's a lot of extraordinary stuff in there, haha.

AI: It sounds like you've found a way to make peace with it, at least for now. You mentioned that you used to feel bad about it but don't think about it much anymore. What shifted for you? Was it just time, or did something specific change in how you view it?

User: I think it was a combination of both? Plus maybe using other AIs like Gemini for things with which I am unfamiliar like SEO optimization. I think it does have its place, I just don't like the idea/narrative that it's going to put a bunch of people out of work, be used to pay people less, or cause people to work MORE because it's being used to benefit the rich/elite to make THEIR lives easier, and not the middle class or poor. The idea is to free up time so that people can work less and enjoy things more, right? Or (over time) take over dangerous tasks so that people don't have to put their lives at risk.

AI: That's a really compelling perspective - the idea that AI should free up time for everyone to enjoy life more, rather than just making certain people's lives easier while potentially displacing others. When you use AI now for tasks like SEO or product descriptions, do you feel like it's actually giving you that benefit - more time to focus on what matters to you?

User: Yes! I hate doing those things. I'm hoping someone makes an AI for product listings, because I hate doing those too, haha. I'll still check the work for mistakes, like I do with any AI, but yes! Please, take the menial stuff off of our hands. Better yet, do my taxes for me, haha

AI: That enthusiasm really comes through! It sounds like there's a clear line for you between the tasks you want to keep versus the ones you're happy to hand off. When you think about your creative work - the actual art-making - what is it about that process that makes you want to protect it from AI involvement?

User: Mostly the end product. Or showing my face along with my art. Seeing way too many deepfakes of people of which I am familiar that have nothing to do with the content posted. Art takes a lot of time, effort, and education. It isn't just something (subjectively) pretty. It's a culmination of everything I am. It says a lot about the time period in which I grew up, what I was exposed to, where I live, my ethnicity, artists I love (their stories, their influences, their styles). I hate the idea of that being thrown into a generator and spitting out something that doesn't mean anything at all. Plus, if you're gonna use my stuff, ask me first (and pay me).

AI: That really captures something powerful - art as this culmination of everything you are and your lived experience. It sounds like for you, the meaning and the human story behind the work is inseparable from the art itself. 

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that feels important to your story?

User: Hmmm. Not really. I think I've made my point. I do appreciate AI as a tool. It's saved me time and I do enjoy brainstorming with it. It's been really helpful. It fills in gaps that I wouldn't be able to. Again, I can't afford to hire people or do hours of research, but I can fact-check the things it recommends.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've drawn those boundaries between using AI as a practical business tool while protecting the deeply personal aspects of your creative work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the tension between practical needs and ethical concerns, and how you've navigated that as a working artist, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
