Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: The  medical software I use is very old as it is a DOS program.  Since that doesn't natively run on windows anymore I use AI to help set up the program using DosBox, and then have it provide all the pathing so that my program can open in one button click.   I also use AI day to day to help with scheduling and provide data analysis on which medical professionals are getting certain types of shifts in order to create a fair and equitable schedule.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI for some very practical technical challenges. It sounds like you're in a scheduling or administrative role in healthcare?

Tell me more about that scheduling and data analysis work. When you say you use AI to analyze which medical professionals are getting certain types of shifts, what does that process actually look like day-to-day?

User: Yes, an administrative role in healthcare.  It involves feeding the current scheduling data into an AI and have it tally each workers shifts and what operating room they are working in for that shift.  Some operating rooms pay more than others so it is important for everyone shifts to be balanced.  AI is then used to provide either a report or charts to visualize who is working where and how often.  If there are large discrepancies, then it becomes obvious on what scheduling needs to be adjusted.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - ensuring fair distribution of those higher-paying OR assignments sounds like it could be quite complex to track manually.

When you're working with AI on this scheduling analysis, do you typically give it all the data at once and ask for a complete report, or do you find yourself going back and forth with it - maybe asking follow-up questions or having it adjust the analysis based on what you see in the initial results?

User: It's a mix of both.  If there have been issues coming up I will do it often as the scheduling information becomes available.  Otherwise, I will feed a few months worth of data if no issues have arisen which allows me to keep an eye on things and ensure the schedule has been fair.

AI: That sounds like a really smart approach - being more reactive when issues pop up versus doing those broader periodic reviews.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to use AI to get a general idea and if things aren't as important.  If serious issues come up, I may still use AI to get some data analysis but I will also be double checking the information myself to ensure nothing is missed.  If nothing is pressing, I feel comfortable with just using AI and not having to double check things as much.  I also do data entry which directly affects how healthcare professionals get paid, and there can be no mistakes or the claims will be rejected.  I would like to maybe one day use AI for this, but currently it is too vital to entrust to AI as there is too much nuance to the entries.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - using the stakes and complexity of the task to determine how much you rely on AI versus your own oversight.

Tell me more about that data entry work where you mentioned there's "too much nuance." What kinds of nuances are you thinking about that make you hesitant to have AI handle those entries right now?

User: The way doctors are paid where I am from is very complex.  The amounts are constantly changing and there are a lot of different charges that  change based on the day or even the patients status.  The billing system is automatically processed by the government and one mistake will cause the entire claim to be rejected.

AI: I see - so even a small error in how you categorize or code something could result in a doctor not getting paid at all for that claim. That's a lot of responsibility.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: We had our main computer die which was still running on windows xp.  The replacement was more modern and not able to natively run DOS.  After struggling to get DosBox set up and run the program, I simply asked AI.  The instructions it gave were flawless and it took less than 5 minutes to set up after struggling for over an hour.

AI: That must have been such a relief! Going from over an hour of frustration to having it working in 5 minutes - I can imagine that was a pretty satisfying moment.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it as well, or are you more of a pioneer in that regard?

User: None of my colleagues use AI so I am the only one.  There's not very many of us at our workplace though.  They are older and not very knowledgeable about AI.

AI: So you're kind of blazing the trail there. Being the only one using AI in a smaller workplace with colleagues who aren't familiar with it - does that affect how you approach using it? Do you find yourself having to explain or justify your methods, or are people generally supportive of what you're doing?

User: I don't really mention that I use AI.  I just provide the information and they just attribute it to me being young and good with computers.

AI: That's an interesting dynamic - getting credit for being "good with computers" while AI is actually helping behind the scenes.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given that you're already using it for analysis and technical setup?

User: Yes, i often think about maintaining my skills.  I think it's important as there will be a long period where you will still need people to review the work done from AI.  Also, if there's ever any technical issues where the AI isn't functioning properly, it is important to still know how to do things yourself.

AI: That's a really practical perspective - having that backup expertise for when technology fails or needs human oversight.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding into new areas, or maybe becoming more confident in areas where you're currently more cautious?

User: I think I will be moving to use AI more in the future, especially as it keeps improving.  I definitely see myself expanding into new areas and have actually really been enjoying AI in my spare time simply as a learning tool.  It makes information extremely accessible, and is able to provide examples instantly.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you adjust your level of AI reliance based on the stakes involved - being more cautious with the billing work but comfortable using it for scheduling analysis and technical setup.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI adoption as the only user in your workplace, and how you balance efficiency gains with the need for accuracy in high-stakes tasks, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
