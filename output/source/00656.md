Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As a teacher, AI is like having a teacher's assistant who is always ready to help. I use AI to build lesson plans, create worksheets,, quizzes and study guides, and research topics.

AI: That's really interesting - you describe it as having a teacher's assistant. 

Can you walk me through what it looks like when you're building a lesson plan with AI? How does that process typically unfold?

User: I will give the AI a topic or idea and ask for suggestions on ways to teach it to my students. Sometimes I already have lessons planned and I share those the with AI so that it can understand what I'm trying to teach.  I usually ask AI to provide me with lists of ideas with brief descriptions and I choose activities from that list and we build on it from there.

AI: That sounds like a pretty collaborative process - you're bouncing ideas back and forth and building on what the AI suggests.

When you say "we build on it from there," what does that back-and-forth look like? Are you refining the AI's suggestions, or asking it to develop certain ideas further?

User: Sometimes I will want to combine tasks or activities, other times I like an idea but maybe not the details of it. Typically I am refining the AI's suggestions.

AI: That makes sense - so you're really using your teaching expertise to shape and refine what the AI generates.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I have found that AI tends to struggle with creating questions from a selected text that tests the reader's knowledge of the information. Many times important information is left out or several questions are too similar. I find myself asking for more questions than I need so I can eliminate the ones that I don't like.

AI: That's a really specific insight - it sounds like you've learned through experience where AI's limitations show up in your work.

When you're creating those reading comprehension questions yourself, what are you looking for or thinking about that the AI seems to miss?

User: I'm looking to make sure that information that is being checked for is important information for the student to remember. I also want to ensure that there are multiple questions that are checking for the same information retention.

AI: So you're thinking strategically about what knowledge is most critical for students to retain, and you want that reinforced through multiple questions - that's really thoughtful pedagogical reasoning.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Lesson planning is very much collaborative. I typically start out with just a topic and maybe a few ideas for activities and really let the AI develop a plan. For example, I may tell the AI that I'm working on a lesson plan for learning about winter holidays around the world. I've already got a few ideas so I'll tell the AI that I want to incorporate the following activities into the plan: craft, food/drink, game/song for each holiday. I'll ask the AI to give me several suggestions for each activity and holiday.

AI: That's a great example of how you set the framework and let AI fill in the details. It sounds like you're really leveraging AI's ability to generate lots of options within the structure you provide.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other teachers using it similarly, or do you find yourself navigating this differently?

User: I feel like it's really mixed views. Some people are very receptive to using AI and others really dislike or maybe distrust it. I feel like the older generations are the most resistant to it. I think its because they've spent years teaching without the assistance of AI and maybe they feel like it's cheating or taking advantage of a system they didn't have access to. I think that it also upsets teachers because of the concern of students using it to get ahead.

AI: That's really insightful - you're picking up on some generational differences and also this tension between AI as a teaching tool versus concerns about student misuse.

How do you personally navigate that dynamic? Do you find yourself being open about your AI use with colleagues, or is it something you approach more cautiously?

User: I'm cautious about sharing my AI use with other teachers who's views I'm unsure of. I may mention hearing of someone using AI to create a game for their students and gage the reaction before going further. If the teacher seems receptive to it I may share more of what I use AI for. I also use it for helping formulate emails to staff and parents and I feel like people are pretty receptive to the idea of running an email through AI like its a spell checker but more.

AI: That's a smart approach - testing the waters first. I like how you describe using AI for emails as "like a spell checker but more" - that seems like a really relatable way to frame it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have a student that really struggles with open-ended questions. They know the information but when asked to provide the information in their own words they freeze up. I have used AI to take the reading materials and the open-ended questions and had it create multiple choice questions. This made it possible for me to truly test the students knowledge in a manner that was compatible with their learning style. I was definitely a high moment as a teacher for me. Others felt as if the student was behind their peers but my testing proved otherwise.

AI: That's such a powerful example - you used AI to create an accommodation that revealed what your student actually knew, rather than just their ability to express it in a particular format. That must have been incredibly validating for both you and the student.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: While I think that in the future AI could play a larger role in education I feel like we

AI: It sounds like you were in the middle of sharing your thoughts there - please continue. What do you feel about AI's future role in education?

User: I feel like education will always need a human touch, especially for our children.

AI: That's an important perspective - you see that human element as irreplaceable in education.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll be using it in different ways as time goes on?

User: I have already seen so much advancements in AI since I began using it as my teaching assistant. I think as more advancements come along I will be able to delegate more of that "busy work" to AI which will allow me more facetime with my students.  I would love to have AI do my grading for me!

AI: That vision of AI handling more of the administrative tasks so you can focus on actual teaching time with students sounds really appealing! Grading definitely falls into that "busy work" category.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your example of how you used AI to create multiple choice questions for your student who struggled with open-ended responses - that really showed how AI can be a tool for more inclusive teaching.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I don't.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a teaching assistant, navigating colleague attitudes, and finding creative ways to support individual students will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear your perspective on how AI is fitting into education. Thanks again!
