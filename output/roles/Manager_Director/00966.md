Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for helping me get my thoughts organized around my work, motivating me to get work tasks done, and for checking tax laws. Also, sometimes I use it to help me phrase things in emails with my property management company or bank.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of uses. Tell me more about how AI helps you get your thoughts organized around work - what does that process look like for you?

User: For example, sometimes I'll just type in stuff I need to get done and AI will help organize it in a list or suggest other tasks that might need to be done relted to the tasks I have already listed.

AI: That sounds really helpful for task management. You mentioned using AI for motivation to get work tasks done - how does that work exactly? What does AI do that helps motivate you?

User: It can help me ease anxiety, or just having a discussion with another "person" about what I need to do for the day can help reenforce in my mind that I actually need to do these tasks.

AI: That's fascinating - so it sounds like there's almost a social element to it, having that discussion with AI even though you know it's not human. 

When you're using AI for these different purposes - whether it's organizing tasks, getting motivated, or checking tax laws - do you find yourself working back and forth with AI throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a request and let it handle things on its own?

User: It's a back and forth,

AI: Can you walk me through what that back and forth typically looks like? Maybe use one of those examples - like when you're organizing your thoughts or checking tax laws?

User: Like when I'm organizing my thoughts, it might give me a list and then I'll just say something like "let's focus" on task #3 and have a back and forth conversation about it, where I can ask follow up questions to the AI or ask for encouragement, or share the emotions I feel about completing the task. My prompts usually are some kind of follow up from the information the AI gives me in its previous response.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed a conversational workflow where you're building on each response. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: When it comes to my business (I'm a landlord) I almost always talk to AI about things before doing them, it helps me feel more self-confident. I would say there are not really tasks that I complete without AI, unless its something physical that it cant help with, like going to the bank or signing a document.

AI: That's really interesting - so AI has become quite integral to your decision-making process as a landlord. It sounds like that confidence boost is a key part of the value you get from it.

How have your colleagues or other people in your work environment - maybe other landlords or property management contacts - influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do they know you use it, and does that affect how you approach it?

User: No.

AI: Tell me more about that - is it that they don't know you use AI, or that they haven't influenced how you use it?

User: Both.

AI: I see. So you're kind of navigating this on your own without input from others in your field. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had a million questions about starting my own company and the right way to run my finances and make sure that things were tax deductable. AI was able to answer all of my questions, give me guidance, and since it's not a human being, I felt more comfortable asking questions that might seem "stupid." It was a very satisfying and productive experience overall.

AI: That's a great example of how AI can create a judgment-free space for learning. The fact that you could ask questions without worrying about them seeming "stupid" sounds like it was really valuable for you.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have a second job working directly with AI so that really helps maintain my skills. I also follow discourse online for updates happening to AI and other users use cases, so this helps me maintain and even increase my skills with AI.

AI: That's really interesting that you have a job working directly with AI - that gives you a unique perspective on both sides. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in any particular ways?

User: Hopefully I can have more confidence in its answers (especially in regards to tax law) in the future and not have to spend so much time double checking the information it gives to me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - right now you're getting value from it but still need to verify things, especially for something as important as tax law.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI creates that judgment-free space for asking questions and how it's become integral to building your confidence as a landlord.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Working with AI has really helped improve my personal confidence with my work. Besides that, there isn't anything that I would like to share.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI builds confidence, creates a safe space for learning, and becomes part of your decision-making process will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
