Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds pretty self-explanatory! Just hope I can answer everything you need to help with your research

AI: Perfect! I appreciate your willingness to help. Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: So my main business I have that involves creative work is using a Cricut machine to vinyl items such as T-shirts & clothing and also vases, wine bottles, glasses, mugs etc as gifts. I can pretty much vinyl most things including photos.  A typical project to me could be designing a logo for a T-shirt, cutting this into vinyl and then applying it with heat.

AI: That sounds like really hands-on, personalized work! I can imagine each project has its own unique requirements depending on what you're creating and who it's for.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Oh it does, it can be so time consuming depending on the design. I have to use a special tool to weed out the vinyl before transferring it. Imagine at Christmas when you have loads to prepare.

AI: That sounds like a lot of intricate work, especially during busy seasons like Christmas! I can imagine the weeding process alone must be quite time-intensive.

I'm curious - in all of that process you described, from designing logos to cutting and applying vinyl, do you use any AI tools along the way? Maybe for design work or any other part of your workflow?

User: I certainly do! I literally get mental block when trying to think of ideas so I use AI to generate these ideas for me, usually Gemini. Gemini will give me design ideas to generate in Cricut and also gift ideas involving vinyl.

AI: That's really interesting! Mental block is something a lot of creative people can relate to, and it sounds like Gemini has become a helpful brainstorming partner for you.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Now let me think, I work on so many projects I don't know whether I am coming or going most days!!  The most recent project I can think of was a friend wanted me to make a unique, memoriable gift for their mum who was turning 90 years old. I didn't want it to be the usual cushion or vase so I asked Gemini to provide me with a list of gift ideas to make. The ideas that Gemini came out with I never would have dreamt of in my wildest dreams, they were so thoughtful and out of the box.

AI: That sounds like exactly the kind of breakthrough you were hoping for! I love that Gemini helped you move beyond the typical options to something more special.

Tell me more about that - what was it like when you saw those unexpected, thoughtful ideas come back from Gemini? How did it feel to get suggestions that were so different from what you might have come up with on your own?

User: To be honest it was a relief and like a weight had lifted off of me. I didn't want to let me friend or her mum down with a rubbish gift idea which would look bad on me but I just could not think of anything. I also had so much going on that, honestly, I just didn't have the time to think either. Gemini saved me time. I felt happy and satisfied if that's how you can describe it I guess. Also optimistic, knowing there was this ability to generate insane ideas to make my business amazing.

AI: That relief you described really comes through - it sounds like Gemini didn't just help with ideas, but actually took some pressure off you during a busy time. 

When you're working with AI like this, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in that process?

User: I don't quite understand this question? do you mean how do I feel working with Gemini to create these ideas?

AI: Yes, exactly! I'm curious about the dynamic between you and Gemini when you're working together. For instance, are you directing Gemini with specific requests, or is it more like Gemini is leading with suggestions that you then choose from? How do you decide what to actually make from the ideas it gives you?

User: Well in this instant I literally just told Gemini the scope which was a gift for a 90th birthday, for a lady, has to be unique and different and Gemini took over and gave me the suggestions. There isn't a set formula I follow to pick which idea to have, I just go with my gut and the one I felt stood out as the most unique and also one I was obviously able to make.

AI: That makes perfect sense - trusting your instincts about what feels right and what's actually feasible for you to create. It sounds like you set the parameters and then let Gemini run with it, but you're still the one making the final creative call.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Nothing has really changed with my creative work since using AI, by using Gemini it has enabled me to create new ideas to make my business thrive and showcase my work and stand out from the crowd but I do still also create my own ideas too.

AI:

User: Nothing has really changed with my creative work since using AI, by using Gemini it has enabled me to create new ideas to make my business thrive and showcase my work and stand out from the crowd but I do still also create my own ideas too.

AI: That's a great distinction - so AI has added to your capabilities rather than replacing how you work. It sounds like you've found a balance between using Gemini for inspiration and still drawing on your own creativity too.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: Regarding my own personal creative work, I do not have any concerns, AI only seems to help make life easier. If you are considering the creative field as a whole then some artists maybe worried about how AI can generate a creative piece of work in seconds when it would take them hours, even days and could ruin their livelihood. As I do not use AI on this level it does not affect me to that depth.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - recognizing that your use case is different from someone who might be creating full artwork from scratch. It sounds like for your business, AI is more of a brainstorming tool rather than doing the actual creative execution.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I really hope my predictions are correct on this one but over the next five years I would love you to be able to tell AI the design you would like in Cricut, for example, say you want to design "Merry Christmas Mum" on a wine bottle. you simply say this and the AI would be able to design this in the Cricut design space, including all of the correct measurements and then determine the correct tools to use to cut the design. It would then load the design to the Cricut machine and cut it and also have another tool to be able to weed the design also so all that is needed is to peel the design at the end to transfer. Having to plan the design in Cricut is so time consuming especially when adding pictures so having AI be able to do this, which I think is more than capable, would be a life saver.

AI: Wow, that's such a specific and vivid vision! You're describing a complete automation of the technical setup process - from design creation all the way through to the cutting and weeding. It really sounds like you've thought about exactly where the time bottlenecks are in your current workflow.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a brainstorming partner that relieves pressure without replacing your creative judgment, and your vision for how it could streamline the technical aspects of your work in the future.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no I think that is everything

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a brainstorming tool, how it provides relief during busy periods, and your vision for future automation in the technical aspects of your work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your process and share such specific examples. Best of luck with your Cricut business!
