Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I am ready

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't currently use AI in my workday much at all. I own and operate a small business that involves designing, making, and selling items for tabletop gaming (board games and role-playing games).  A lot of what I do involves 3d design, hand-making products, and selling items at in person events or shipping items for online sales. Those tasks don't currently lend themselves to AI tool use much. I have used a few AI tools for small, specific tasks, such as using AI tools to edit pictures to edit out things in my product pictures that I don't want to have appear in my listing (background items, dust or other debris, etc.).

AI: That's really interesting - you're working in a very hands-on, creative field. It sounds like most of your core work involves physical creation and in-person interactions.

Tell me more about those times when you have used AI tools for image editing. What led you to try AI for those tasks specifically?

User: I noticed the AI options in the Windows photo editing menu when editing product pictures, so I tried out the "magic eraser" type tool (I don'

AI: It sounds like you discovered those AI editing features just by exploring what was available in your usual photo editing workflow.

What was that experience like when you first tried the magic eraser tool? How did it work out for your product photos?

User: Sorry, my last answer was accidentally cut off. I tried using the magic eraser tool (I don't remember if that is the correct name or not), located in the onboard photo editing software in Windows 10, specifically to remove visible dust and hairs from macro pictures of my products. I tend to take very close up shots, so any small debris that sticks to a product just from handling it can show up in picutures. This tool was really effective for erasing visible dust and debris. I now use it frequently when editing product photos, and it has saved me from having to retake my pictures many times.

AI: That sounds like it's become a really practical part of your workflow. It's interesting how it solved a specific, recurring problem you were having with those close-up product shots.

When you think about your work more broadly - the 3D design, the hands-on making, the in-person selling - are there particular tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even if AI tools might be able to help with them?

User: I think those three categories are generally the types of things I prefer to do myself, though I am open to assistance for some of the more repetitive aspects of them. I don't know how AI would help me with the physical making of molds or casting of my products, but I do know there are AI tools built into the 3d design software I use. Last I checked, Fusion (formally Fusion 360), charged extra for AI tokens to automate some of the repetitive aspects of CAD design. I still want to be the one to design my items, but I wouldn't mind more access to tools that make things easier. Specifically, things that can predict a pattern of repeated actions and automate those instead of clicking through each action repeatedly, or tools that can be used to check for common issues like lines in a drawing that aren't connected. In person sales at conventions are also one of the best parts of my job, so I wouldn't want to give that up. I am open to assistance with handling online communication with customers, but most direct messages I get need to be handles by me.

AI: It sounds like you have a clear sense of what you want to keep doing yourself versus where you'd welcome some assistance. You mentioned being open to AI help with online customer communication, but that most direct messages need your personal attention.

What makes those direct messages something that requires your involvement? What happens in those interactions that makes them need your personal touch?

User: Most direct messages I get for the business are related to either product questions or feedback. The questions are often extremely unique, like a person asking for a unique custom order that I generally take on a case-by-case basis. The feedback is often just a kind personal message from a customer I've met at a convention or sold to online repeatedly. These customers reach out to tell me that they really appreciate the care and personal touches we put into our business, so using an AI response would really work against me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those personal connections and custom requests are clearly central to your business model and customer relationships.

When you do use AI for work tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? For instance, with those photo editing tools, are you working alongside the AI to guide the process, or do you set it up and let it handle things independently?

User: The few AI tools I use are generally situation-specific tools that do one thing only and are not managed by any larger model. The magic eraser I use in photos simply requires that I click on that tool while I am editing other aspects of the photos, then I carefully "paint" the portion of the photo I want erased and the AI tool fills in that space with what it predicts should be there if there wasn't that blemish or piece of dust. I have not used any chatbot type tools for my business so far, and I have not had access (due to cost mostly) to more complex tools that can automate things such as image processing for me completely.

AI: That's a helpful distinction - you're using these focused, single-purpose AI features rather than broader AI systems. It sounds like you're very hands-on in directing exactly what gets edited in those photos.

How have your colleagues or others in the tabletop gaming business community influenced the way you think about using AI in your work? Do you hear much discussion about AI tools in your industry?

User: The small businesses I know that create art and handmade or unique items for gaming don't generally discuss the use of AI favorably. This is especially true amongst artists that make their income with hand drawn fanart and commissioned art, as they are rightfully concerned about AI making their careers obsolete. They also make an excellent point about AI models using the work of artist that is posted online to train image generation models without compensation. They are extremely concerned about AI image generation and many conventions I attend have strict policies against AI generated art being sold. As models get better though, it is getting harder to tell what is and isn't hand drawn. The one line of business that I think would be more open to incorporating AI is the many 3D printers I encounter at conventions. Because of the amount of time it takes to maintain and operate a print farm, those who sell prints generally only operate the print farm and do not design the items they sell. They generally obtain royalty free designs online (less common) or pay to access and sell the models that others design. These designers generally focus just on design and don't sell the physical items at scale. Because of the seperation between those that print the products and those that design the products, I think people would be more open to the use of AI to generate designs if it was economical. Personally, I am most worried about that, though, because one of the things that makes my business stand out is that I both design and print my unique designs.

AI: That's a really insightful view into how AI is perceived across different parts of your industry ecosystem. It sounds like there's a real tension between the concerns about AI replacing creative work and the practical realities of business operations.

Can you share a specific time when using AI at work - even just those photo editing tools - made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It was very satisfying to discover that the photo editing tool could accomplish in approximately a minute of computational time what would take me much longer if I had to retake photos of my products.

AI: That time-saving aspect really stands out. It sounds like discovering that efficiency was a pretty positive moment.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? You mentioned being concerned about AI-generated designs affecting what makes your business unique - is this something you actively consider as you plan for your business?

User: It really is something I consider a lot, though it is not something I have all of the solutions for. Based on how quickly unique ideas in this creative industry are copied by other makers, I tend to decide what I will only sell in person and what I am willing to put online (where it can be seen by many more people researching ideas to copy) based on how challenging the 3d design is. I have  one product that is a pretty simple 3d design that I have held off putting online because it will be very easy for others to copy. I continue to generate new ideas for these, but they are primarily unique because I have worked hard to come up with many unique jokes that are printed on these items. I absolutely beleive that anyone who has even basic 3d design skills can copy these after seeing them, so I limit how I market them. I have another 3d design that involves a hard to support 3d print with several interlocking parts and built in hinges that print in place. I have had this design in my online shop from the beginning because someone may be able to copy the creative touches or phrases I have on the item, but it would take some skill and lot of effort to create an item with all of the functionality mine has. I think a lot about how this is likely to change in the coming years. As AI begins to help makers generate 3d objects without requiring extensive skills, we will all have to come up with unique ideas more often to keep ahead of those that copy new and unique ideas. To meet the new demand, we will likely turn to AI to help generate creative ideas, but I'm not sure how unique those will be.

AI: That's a really thoughtful strategic approach - using the complexity of design and manufacturing as a kind of natural protection for your ideas. Your point about potentially needing AI to generate ideas faster to stay ahead of copiers, while questioning how unique those AI-generated ideas would be, really captures an interesting dilemma.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself incorporating more AI tools, or do you think you'll mostly stick with the focused, single-purpose tools you're using now?

User: I think I will generally stick with the focused, single-purpose tools available to me for the most part. I do plan to try generating more creative product ideas by talking to creative focused AI tools. I also plan to search out more tools to assist with accounting and other aspects of the business that aren't as focused on my creative passion.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you strategically think about which products to sell online versus in-person based on design complexity, and how that might need to evolve as AI capabilities change.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think everyone heavily involved with the creation and evolution of AI should really think about the impact AI is having on replacing creatives with tools that were trained nonconsensually with the art of those creatives. I don't feel this is something that anyone could or even should stop, but I think some outreach to these affected communities to get their feedback and even collaborate with them would go a long way in bridging the divide between creatives and those designing new AI tools. The sentiment in the 2d artist community is pretty angry about this topic, but I also think their skills could be employed in creating better tools for everyone if you can find a way to bring them to the table.

AI: Thank you for sharing that perspective - that's a really important point about the need for more collaboration and dialogue with creative communities who are directly affected by these changes.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI as a creative business owner, from the practical tools that save you time to the broader industry concerns, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thanks!

AI: You're very welcome! I really appreciated hearing about your unique perspective as someone working at the intersection of creative design and small business. Take care!
