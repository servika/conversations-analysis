Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today - I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: perfect

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I work in theoretical physics, specifically on detecting ultalight dark matter using atom interferometry. A recent project has involved modelling the impact gravity gradient noise from vibrations in the surroundings has on the interferometer, and whether this noise can be removed from any proposed dark matter signal that might be detected. We wrote a paper, currently in review, which proposed a generalised mechanism for modelling the noise produced by moving point particles.

AI: That sounds like fascinating work - the intersection of dark matter detection and precision measurement is really compelling.

When you think about that process from developing the generalized mechanism through to writing the paper that's currently in review, where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI tools frequently in the codewriting process in the creation of our noise modelling tool, both for debugging and writing parts of the code that either required modules I was unfamiliar with, or was tedious code that didn't really need my input (such as making graphs with matplotlib)

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI became a practical coding assistant for you. 

For those specific tasks - the debugging, working with unfamiliar modules, and creating visualizations - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of maybe looking up documentation or working through it manually.

User: AI is much faster for things like debugging than manually combing through a large codebase, as it catches things like missing colons or syntax errors much faster than a human could. It's also great for doing things like graph plotting, as looking up specific matplotlib commands is tedious and takes time, whereas an AI can implement them straight away

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the speed advantage for catching those syntax errors and handling the more routine coding tasks seems really valuable.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like developing the theoretical framework for the generalized mechanism, the mathematical modeling, or writing the actual paper - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: I did use AI in writing, but more for spellcheck/grammar checks at the end. I find that AI hasn't quite mastered scientific writing yet, as it often isn't concise enough and tends to add unneccesary fluff

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - it sounds like AI's writing style doesn't align with the precision and conciseness that scientific writing demands.

When you've used AI for the coding tasks you mentioned - the debugging, unfamiliar modules, matplotlib visualizations - how do you verify or validate what it produces before incorporating it into your research?

User: mostly by just checking the code runs, that its result makes physical sense, and is sensible compared to other outputs i have previously produced.

AI: That's a very practical approach - testing functionality and checking against your domain knowledge and previous results.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'm curious - if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I'd like it if AI were able to help explore new ideas theoretically. Currently, AI's approach is very grounded in existing science, but doesn't seem to be able to take the creative step in theoretical research

AI: That's a really fascinating point - the distinction between synthesizing existing knowledge versus that creative leap that theoretical research requires.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on how AI excels at the more routine technical tasks while still falling short of the creative theoretical work was particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: AI is a fantastic resource for LaTeX formatting in physics and maths research, and really speeds up my scientific writing process compared to colleagues who still do it all manually

AI: That's a great addition - LaTeX formatting is such a specific technical skill that can be really time-consuming to master manually. It sounds like AI has become quite integrated into multiple aspects of your workflow, from coding to formatting.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI being excellent for routine technical tasks while still lacking that creative theoretical leap really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The distinction you drew between where AI adds clear value versus where human creativity is still essential was particularly valuable.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!

User: thank you

AI: You're very welcome! I really enjoyed our conversation and learned a lot from your perspective. Best of luck with your paper review and your continued work on dark matter detection - it sounds like truly cutting-edge research. Take care!
