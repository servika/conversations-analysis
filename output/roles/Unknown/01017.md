Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I'm ready to begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a lab technician for an ecology lab and often compile spreadsheets of data, or interpret and analyze data. I will sometimes use AI to fix errors in a spreadsheet (formatting and troubleshooting) or to organize/archive files. I have also used AI to search for published articles that may pertain to the topic of our research.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're working with AI on these different tasks - whether it's fixing spreadsheet errors, organizing files, or searching for research articles - how do you typically approach the interaction?

For example, when you have a spreadsheet that needs fixing, do you tend to work back and forth with the AI to solve it step by step, or do you usually describe the whole problem and let the AI handle it from start to finish?

User: It depends on the context. When troubleshooting, I will usually work back and forth step by step with the AI, but when fixing formatting I will let the AI handle it.

AI: That's an interesting distinction. What makes troubleshooting different for you - what is it about that process that makes you want to work through it step by step rather than handing it off completely?

User: I honestly don't want to grow too dependent on AI. I enjoy some aspects of troubleshooting/problem solving and I like to figure things out as far as I can on my own before turning to AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach. Can you tell me more about what you enjoy about the troubleshooting process? What is it that makes you want to preserve that for yourself?

User: I think that it's important to use critical thinking skills for oneself on a regular basis and by trying to fix the issue by myself, I often learn in the process.

AI: That makes a lot of sense. I'm curious about your colleagues and your workplace - how have they influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your lab has a particular culture around AI use, or have your coworkers' approaches affected how you think about using it?

User: My colleagues are not particularly fond of AI. I have known some to use it for minor writing tasks such as "how should I reply to this email?" or "make this sound more formal," but aside from that, it's not used much.

AI: How does that atmosphere affect your own AI use? Do you find yourself being more cautious about when or how you use it, or does it not really influence your decisions?

User: I think that before I was in this work atmosphere, I was already mindful of how and when to use AI. The atmosphere does not really affect my decisions.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Using AI, I was able to find a relevant article regarding a very niche topic of interest. This article provided our research with a much more cost effective and simple method than we had been planning to perform.  I was unable to find this article with any of the keywords I had been using to search before.

AI: That sounds like a really valuable discovery! Tell me more about that search process. What made the AI able to find something you couldn't locate through your usual search methods?

User: It was a paper from the 1990's that hadn't gotten much attention. It really had nothing to do with what our lab was actively studying, but the protocol introduced was applicable for our topic. The AI had found this based off of a search for methods similar to the one we had been planning to use.

AI: That's fascinating - the AI was able to make those connections across different research areas and time periods that you might not have thought to explore. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you use it, or do you think you'll maintain pretty much the same approach?

User: I feel like I will most likely maintain the same approach in the future. I can appreciate the use of AI for overall work efficiency, but will continue to handle tasks that require critical thinking and analysis myself.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between efficiency and preserving your own critical thinking skills - and that example of the AI finding that 1990s paper was a great illustration of how it can make unexpected connections.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I don't think so.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that thoughtful balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while preserving your own problem-solving skills will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Thanks!

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day.
