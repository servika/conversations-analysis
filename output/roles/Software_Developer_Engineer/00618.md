Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, hit me Claude

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure, I am a programmer, so I use AI to help figure things out, or to get me started on some new code. I can explain further on each, what should I tackle first?

AI: Let's start with using AI to figure things out. Can you walk me through a recent example of when you used it that way?

User: Sure. I have never used python before at work. I mainly code in COBOL, SQL, and Java. I had to create a utility to autonomously and automatically transfer files from an ftp-ed location to our postgres database. Python is the best tool for this, so I had to figure out how to do it. The first thing I asked AI was how to setup my environment. This would have been really tricky without someone to guide me because I am coding on a Windows OS but need to launch in our AWS Linux space. Once the setup was complete there was a lot of troubleshooting to get to. I had to setup the .env to connect to both our DB2 databases and our ACE server which is where our APIs live.

AI: Tell me more about that troubleshooting process. How did you work with AI during those connection setup challenges?

User: Well the AI gave me a blueprint to follow, but there were hiccups along the way. For example I ran into firewall issues which, of course, the AI couldn't help me with. Then I couldn't figure out a particular issue, and realized the python versioning was wrong with the step-by-step walkthrough the AI provided. Basically they would provide me with a blueprint, and as I had questions along the way or issues, they would help me solve them

AI: When you hit those issues like the firewall or version mismatch, how did you decide what to bring back to the AI versus what you'd figure out yourself?

User: Since I have so little experience in Python, I went back to the AI straight away. I had an idea there was a firewall issue, so I just confirmed that with the error message I was receiving with the AI. When the versioning issue occurred, I just went right to AI. It is much faster than combing through message boards

AI: You mentioned AI also helps you get started on new code. How does that typically work for you?

User: Sure, this was especially helpful with a recent project. There were legacy Java reports we did not have source code for, that I needed to recreate. I knew how to call the proper APIs we had developed, but the formatting was a huge issue. We are talking about graphical charts. So I would create my own skeleton, then ask about formatting. This was a bit of a headache and I had to consult multiple models until I found a good one. One model kept leading me in the wrong direction, and then I found one that was really helpful

AI: What made that one model particularly helpful compared to the others that were leading you in the wrong direction?

User: Simply put, the code it provided worked! It got very close in style to the original reports. I could then go back to the AI with questions, or fix the issue myself, whether it was text size or color or the way the graph was drawn

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them?

User: Not really, I would honestly rather just have AI do all of the simple tasks or the tasks I know it can handle. My work needs to get done. I don't care how that is achieved

AI: When you say "tasks I know it can handle," how do you determine which tasks fall into that category?

User: Well I am good at writing SQL and I make a lot of stored procedures. I know the best way to handle this, so AI would honestly just be slower and probably less accurate

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not much. Our sprint leader uses copilot to do meeting summaries, but I don't worry about that. We have a business license for copilot but I don't think it is as effective as other tools. I will just access AI on a personal PC with questions

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It is really just the Java reports. That has been the biggest use of AI. So it in turn made me feel frustrated and satisfied. Sometimes it was great and I felt really accomplished. Other times, it was a frustrating experience that felt like banging my head against a wall

AI: What made the difference between those satisfying moments and the head-banging ones during that Java reports project?

User: The difference was in how the AI communicated and listened to my complaints about the quality of the code they were providing. Sometimes they provided the same code which, as you can imagine, was frustrating

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yeah, I think it is definitely a fear, but unchecked AI makes a hell of a lot of mistakes. Without a programmer to guide it, it will not be helpful. I also have great system knowledge. AI will not understand our datamodel or systems

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Not evolving at all. It will probably stay about the same. I ask it questions when I need to

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI needs a programmer to guide it and catch its mistakes - that balance between leveraging its capabilities while recognizing where human expertise remains essential.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, don't think so

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating between different AI models to find what works, and how you use AI as a faster alternative to searching through documentation and message boards, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
