Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I do not have any questions.

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in the regulatory and compliance department of a telecommunications company with a heavy focus on grant applications and grant administration.  I use AI regularly to (1) interpret regulations, statues, or other legal text and apply that to specific questions or situations, (2) summarize grant funding opportunities, rules, or other administrative text, (3) answer questions related to specific grant programs to find answers to questions or situations we are facing, and (4) drafting or rewriting including grant applications, letters, emails, or other correspondence, inter-departmental communications, departmental articles for newsletters, etc. Additionally, but less often, I use it for image creation.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're using AI across quite a range of tasks in your regulatory and compliance work.

When you're working on these different types of tasks - whether it's interpreting regulations, summarizing funding opportunities, or drafting applications - tell me more about how you actually interact with the AI. Do you typically work back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you give it a complete task to handle on its own?

User: A little of both. Most of the time, I will give a little background for context and then ask the specific question I'm trying to find an answer to.  Occasionally, a model will come back with follow up questions, or the response will prompt further discussion that leads to more back and forth discussion.

AI: That makes sense - starting with context and a specific question, then letting the conversation develop naturally based on what comes back.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Not really. I am still learning how to use AI in my job, so there are probably a lot of things I can use it for that I don't, just because it doesn't occur to me to try it.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - being in that learning phase where you're discovering new possibilities. 

Can you walk me through a specific example of how you used AI recently for one of your work tasks? I'd love to hear about the actual process - what prompted you to use it, how the interaction went, and what the outcome was.

User: Most recently (earlier today, actually), we had a situation arise where a reporting agency on one of our grant awards notified us that certain expenses were unallowable for reimbursement/payment using grant funds.  We disagreed with this finding because (1) we had a contract with our vendor stating the expenses would be included and the agency had reviewed and approved the contract, and (2) the agency had approved previous requests including those disallowed expenses.  There are many different documents and regulations for this program and finding this particular answer would be very time consuming and tedious.  I decided to ask AI for assistance. I asked the AI bot if these specific expenses were eligible under this grant program.  The bot gave a thorough response referencing various rules, regulations, and gave me things to consider to evaluate whether the specific feedback applied to my particular grant award. It also suggested that it could look deeper if I provided my specific state and other details that applied to my actual award.  Ultimately, I did receive the answer I was looking for, and also gained instant citations referring back to the documents so I could follow up if needed.

AI: That's a great example - it really shows how AI helped you navigate through complex regulatory materials efficiently. It sounds like getting those citations was particularly valuable so you could verify and reference the source material.

When you got that thorough response with the rules and regulations, did you find yourself trusting the AI's interpretation right away, or did you feel the need to double-check things? How do you typically handle verification when AI gives you regulatory or legal guidance?

User: Since I was fairly familiar with the regulations, rules, and information that AI cited, I trusted it right away.  The information was familiar, I just wasn't sure where to go to find it myself, so AI cut down on a lot of my research time. I did not feel the need to double-check in this particular instance. However, if I was less certain or working through something more critical (such as regulatory filings to the FCC or other agency that could impact our company in a negative way), I might follow up by reading the cited materials in more detail to confirm the context and response myself.

AI: That's really insightful - you're making those judgment calls based on your familiarity with the material and the stakes involved. It sounds like you have a good sense of when to rely on the AI versus when to dig deeper yourself.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your department using it similarly, or are you more of an early adopter?

User: Others in my department use AI in a similar fashion that I do.  However, other departments use AI much more heavily than I do. Marketing uses it a lot to create images, articles, etc., where our technical departments use it in more technical ways that I am unfamiliar with.

AI: Interesting that there's variation across departments in how heavily AI is being used. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The situation I described this morning actually made me very satisfied.  Even though the response isn't necessarily what I would have liked, it was thorough and response, and gave me the answer that I needed without having to spend a ton of time sifting through hundreds of pages of material myself.

AI: That satisfaction of getting a thorough, accurate answer quickly really comes through. It sounds like the time savings was a big part of what made that experience positive.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do not believe that AI will completely take over my job. I believe there is a benefit to human review that will remain for quite a long time. However, I constantly look for ways to improve or get better in my job, with or without the AI component.

AI: That confidence in the value of human review is really interesting - it sounds like you see AI as enhancing your capabilities rather than replacing them.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll be using it differently a year from now?

User: I hope so. I hope to continue to use AI in ways that can make my work more efficient and maybe provide some automation in some areas.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you make judgment calls about when to trust AI responses versus when to dig deeper based on your familiarity with the material and the stakes involved.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for regulatory and compliance work - especially how you navigate trust and verification based on context and stakes - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
