Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That is ok.

AI: Great, thank you. Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it mainly to help in coding (Python) and data analysis. Also occasionally for enhanced web search or technical consultations.

AI: That's helpful context. When you're using AI for coding and data analysis, what does that actually look like day-to-day? Can you walk me through a specific example of how you might use it during a typical project?

User: I may be writing some code and need help on writing a specific function. maybe I don not remember the best way to do it or is something new for me.

AI: Tell me more about that process. When you're stuck on a function like that, how do you typically interact with the AI? Do you describe what you're trying to accomplish, paste in your existing code, or approach it differently?

User: I describe what I'm trying to accomplish and normally the AI has the context since I am using VS Code with GitHub Copilot.

AI: That's interesting that you're using GitHub Copilot within VS Code. How does having that integrated context change the way you work compared to when you might use a separate AI tool? Does it feel different having the AI right there in your coding environment?

User: It is more convenient. I do not need to paste long strings of code and normally it is able to get my programming style.

AI: That makes sense about the convenience. You mentioned it picks up on your programming style - can you give me an example of what that looks like? How does it adapt to the way you prefer to write code?

User: It my get variable names from previous code, not necessarily the one relevant to that task. I believe it has access to many project files and may take solutions previously used in those.

AI: So it's drawing from your broader project context, not just the immediate code you're working on. When it pulls in variable names or solutions from other parts of your project like that, how accurate is it usually? Does it generally make the right connections, or do you find yourself having to correct it often?

User: It often makes good choices, but not always. It is necessary to check carefully that it is correct .

AI: That careful checking you mentioned - that sounds like an important part of your workflow. Are there certain types of functions or coding situations where you're more cautious about trusting the AI's suggestions, or does your level of scrutiny stay pretty consistent regardless of the task?

User: I will normally check that the results make sense and often try to understand precisely what the code is doing. The level of of understanding the code may depend on how critical is that part of the code.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - adjusting your level of scrutiny based on how critical that code is. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain coding tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I try to offload as much as possible to AI, but I frequently find that it is faster to write the code myself than to try to explain to the AI what I need.

AI: That's a really interesting trade-off you're describing. Can you give me an example of a situation where you decided it was faster to just write the code yourself rather than explain it to the AI? What made that particular task difficult to communicate?

User: If I know well how to write some piece of code, it is more reliable to do it myself. The AI is only useful for me when I don't know exactly or don't remember how to do something and would need to do web searches to find the exact syntax or functions to use. For top-level instructions to AI to write long pieces of code I found it useful only for things like translating code from one language to another. Other tasks require too much context or too long and precise instructions and the AI may not give the desired output.

AI: That's a very clear distinction you're making - using AI when you need to look up syntax or functions versus doing it yourself when you already know how. When you do use AI for those lookup-type situations, how does that change your learning? Do you find yourself retaining that information for next time, or do you end up going back to the AI for similar questions?

User: I may get back for similar questions. But sometimes I learn some new trick that I may apply directly myself.

AI: That's interesting - so there's this mix of repeat assistance and actual learning happening. When you do pick up those new tricks that you can apply directly, what tends to make the difference? Is it something about how the AI explains it, or the type of problem, or something else that helps it stick?

User: It is normally something simple that I may not have come across before or did not realize myself.

AI: That makes sense - those simple but new-to-you techniques. Now thinking about your interaction pattern with AI, when you are using it for work, are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Most often I collaborate throughout the task.

AI: Can you describe what that collaboration looks like in practice? How do you typically go back and forth with the AI as you're working through a task together?

User: I just ask questions when I have some problem that I don't know how to solve.

AI: So it sounds like you're really driving the process and pulling the AI in when you hit specific roadblocks. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others around you use it differently, or is there any particular attitude about AI tools in your workplace?

User: I'm not sure.

AI: That's fair - it can be hard to know how others are using these tools. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I felt quite satisfied once that I asked to translate some code from C to Python and it got it right on the first attempt.

AI: That sounds like a great experience! What made that translation particularly satisfying - was it the complexity of the code, or that it saved you a lot of time, or something else about how smoothly it went?

User: I did not understand much of the C code and it saved me a lot of time.

AI: That's a perfect example of AI filling a real knowledge gap for you. On the flip side, have you had any particularly frustrating experiences when using AI for work? What made those situations difficult?

User: It is difficult to delegate tasks that need a lot of context. It requires too long prompts and tend to provide bad results.

AI: That context challenge sounds really limiting. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think about it occasionally, but I do not see AI advancing as quickly as it is often forecasted.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future, or do you think your current approach will stay fairly consistent?

User: I guess it will evolve. But I'm not sure that the changes will be very dramatic.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your clear distinction between when AI is helpful versus when it's faster to just do things yourself - that balance between leveraging AI for knowledge gaps while maintaining your own expertise.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that is all. Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you strategically use AI - especially around that trade-off between explanation time versus just coding it yourself - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
