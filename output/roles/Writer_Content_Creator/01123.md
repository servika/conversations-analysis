Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. I'm ready to begin.

AI: Perfect. Let's start with getting to know a bit about your work. Could you tell me about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a writer, primarily of science fiction and fantasy, so a project for me would be a book or a series of books, which can take months or years from start to finish. Rarely, I write a short story and that's more a matter of somewhere from hours to days, maybe weeks. But however big/long the project, they all go through similar phases of developing an idea; doing some pre-writing research, world-building, character development, initial plot development; the writing itself, which often includes revisiting earlier stages; an editing/revision/rewrite stage; and the final polish stage of editing. It's not a neat and tidy checklist of steps, but those are the general stages.

AI: That's a great overview of your process. Now I'm curious about how AI fits into that journey. Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process - where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I will sometimes use AI for research purposes, to help me get an overview of a topic and ideas on where I might need to do some deeper learning or give me ideas I might want to expand on, possibly point me toward resources where I can go and do more extensive research myself. I prefer not to rely on AI for research or learning, because it's still prone to inaccuracy and hallucination, but it's sometimes convenient for rounding up general information and giving me a starting point. And also just because I enjoy learning about things for myself, so I don't want to give up that part of the process. In the past, I'd do a Google search and check links and read general articles to get an overview point and then start doing the deeper research from there, so AI is essentially doing that initial Google search and general reading and compiling it for me.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using AI as that initial research springboard while maintaining your own deeper learning process. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI in this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I'm not a scientist, but I enjoy writing sci fi, so learning the science that underpins some of the usual science fiction elements is part of the job. I had developed a planet with a specific set of characteristics that I needed for the purpose of the story, but it was not Earth-like, so I asked AI to help me determine things like weather and day/night cycles and what color the sky would be and, most importantly, what other things might be different which I hadn't even thought about. It provided me with a list of suggestions and, most importantly, reasons for those suggestions, so I was able to do deeper research into what it was telling me. It got a couple of details not quite right, but they were details I might not have thought to include at all otherwise.

AI: That sounds like a really productive collaboration - getting both the suggestions and the reasoning behind them so you could verify and build on them. When you're working with AI in situations like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am definitely the decision-maker. I use AI responses the same way I use any other piece of nonfiction or even fiction that I read. Or for that matter, any other media or life experience. I see the sparks of what might be useful to include in a story and what to do with that spark.

AI: That's a clear sense of agency you maintain. I'm curious - what aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I spend less time clicking links and reading general knowledge articles to compile basic information during the research phase of writing. In much the same way that pre-computer, I had to go to the library and drag physical books to a table and page through them and make notes with pen and paper but then having the same (and more) information available at my fingertips on a computer made research more efficient and convenient, now using AI makes the process a little more efficient and convenient.

AI: That's a helpful analogy - seeing it as the next step in research efficiency. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I personally don't have a ton of concerns about AI in the field of writing. There's pirating, but there's always been pirating. There's AI writing stories and "stealing" readers, allegedly, but if readers think AI-written stories are "good," then that's their business, and they're probably not my market anyhow. Computers and ebooks and indie publishing made it both harder and easier to be a writer. AI makes it both harder and easier to be a writer. Honestly, most writers aren't making a commercial living from writing anyhow, and many more of them than will admit it aren't in it for the money, anyhow.

AI: That's a really pragmatic perspective on the market changes. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Assuming AI improves at providing accurate information and not hallucinating, it may continue to make the research phase of my writing process more efficient. On the other hand, it's not entirely about efficiency. I enjoy digging around for information and learning new things, so I don't necessarily want my information summarized and spoon fed to me.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining agency as the decision-maker and your analogy of AI as another step in the evolution of research tools - from physical libraries to computers to AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't have anything to add.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I found your balanced perspective on AI as a research efficiency tool - while maintaining your enjoyment of the learning process itself - really valuable. Have a great day!
