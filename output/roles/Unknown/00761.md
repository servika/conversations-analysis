Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, Claude. No questions on my end, so please feel free to proceed whenever you're ready.

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In the course of my typical workday, I use AI primarily as a soundboard for creative writing. I work in the Tabletop Gaming division of a touring convention circuit, which means that I am constantly generating new content for TTRPGs. As much as I enjoy doing it, it's simply infeasible for me to come up with the amount of unique content it takes to run these events within the time constraints of my day-to-day. When I am writing scenarios for personal reasons, I can take months or weeks to hone ideas. However, these are designed for long-term campaigns, which takes an extensive level of detail. 

For my work events, I need to have a variety of one-shots and characters ready to go every few weeks, and sometimes even more frequently than that. AI is a fantastic sounding board for taking general concepts and hammering them into something unique for our guests in a timely fashion, and saves me from draining all my creative capital. While I do not think it is quite at the point that it can write the modules themselves, it can suggest plot points or character ideas that help point me in the right direction. 

In addition to that, AI has previously helped me script tutorials for games I am familiar with but don't have a great plan to teach those who aren't, and has helped me write ad copy to help advertise upcoming events and featured guests.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become a crucial creative partner in managing the volume demands of your work. 

Tell me more about that process of using AI as a sounding board for scenarios and characters. When you say you take a general concept and hammer it into something unique, what does that back-and-forth typically look like?

User: You know, at first, I felt extremely awkward using AI, but it quickly emerged as a fantastic resource for organizing my thoughts and helping to push them forward in a logical direction.

Let me think if I can come up with a recent example. Oh, okay, so one of the more popular events at the convention is a Live Play D&D stage show, where celebrity guests get up on a stage and play a session in front of attendees. To keep things interesting, the same character never gets played twice, and the guests have no idea what character they will be playing until the week of the show. 

Somehow it feel to me to come up with a list of characters that were well-defined enough that the guests didn't have to make everything up from scratch, but open-ended enough that they could put their own spin on things. Once I got the details of the campaign setting, I put together a short description of the general setting and plot line, then asked how it thought each of the different character classes would fare in such a setting.

Without giving any specific character details, it gave a great account of what the function of each class might be in that setting, and how they may or may not fit into the greater world-building. From those answers, I assembled a group consisting of some that fit well and one that fit quite poorly. We then workshopped why that character might exist in this world totally hostile to their existence, and the backstory we came up with actually ended up being a highlight of the show.

AI: That's a really compelling example - especially how the "poorly fitting" character ended up being a highlight. It sounds like AI helped you think through the world-building logic in a way that sparked creativity rather than replacing it.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned that AI isn't quite at the point where it can write the modules themselves - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: While I appreciate all that AI can do, I am still wary of certain purely creative elements. Elements of humor, suspense, and particularly unexpected plot twists can be difficult to master when they AI has to pull from preexisting material. I've seen it masterfully remix its training data into original concepts, but I have also seen it return immediately recognizable work. 

Once the AI has helped me get to a point where I understand the characters and the general arc of the plot, I genuinely enjoy the writing process in between. In addition, I have always believed writing is a process of discovery, and some of the best bits arise organically as the piece is written. When the work is handed off, those opportunities are missed, and the work suffers (as do I, having missed out on those glorious "ah-hah!" moments).

AI: That's such an insightful distinction - the idea that writing is a process of discovery and those "ah-hah!" moments are part of what makes the work fulfilling for you personally.

When you are using AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like you collaborate with it throughout certain phases, but then take full ownership of others. How do you decide when to stay in that collaborative mode versus when to go it alone?

User: That's an excellent question, to which I am not sure there is a definitive answer. I prefer to begin conversationally rather than just punch in some input and let things run, as that helps to explore different facets of the idea. Inevitably one of us will stumble across a hook I am interested in and we will unpack that for a while, jumping around from the large-scale concept to small details as the conversation leads us. At some point, I will feel that I have enough that I "understand" the story and can take it from there, though that does not preclude me from revisiting the AI later in the process if I get stuck or if I feel an element of the project isn't working.

AI: That conversational approach you describe is really interesting - it sounds quite organic and intuitive. You mentioned that at some point you feel like you "understand" the story enough to take it from there.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your field approaching it similarly, or have you noticed different attitudes toward AI use in the tabletop gaming industry?

User: As my department is essentially just me at this point, and I am performing duties wildly different than anyone else is, neither my colleagues nor my workplace culture have much influence on my use of AI.

I have no knowledge of anyone else in my field using AI similarly, though in all fairness I know very few people in my extremely narrow field. I have experienced some hostility against the use of AI in any form in the creative space, especially in the TTRPG field, though that tends to focus more on the worries about replacing paid jobs for artists and writers. I take no payment or credit for what I do with these modules (they are just an additional responsibility I happen to take on to improve guest experiences), so I share none of these qualms.

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like you've carved out your own approach somewhat independently, and the specific nature of your role shields you from some of the broader industry concerns.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: My use of AI for work has been incredibly consistent, with no particular highs or lows other than my own frustrations with my ability to create unique input leading me to repeat scenarios closely. However, this is more of a user error than anything, and I would have had the same problem even if AI were not a factor.

AI: That consistency you describe is really telling - it suggests you've found a working rhythm that fits your needs.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? You mentioned that AI helps preserve your creative capital rather than draining it - is this something you actively consider, or does it feel more natural given your workflow?

User: I feel like I have spent enough time with AI to recognize it as an incredibly powerful tool in the creative market, akin to something like Photoshop. Those who put the effort into learning how to implement it properly can elevate their skills incredibly, while those who know little about it worry that it will replace creative entities entirely. I simply do not see that as the case. 

In addition to being a soundboard, AI can be an incredible researcher, fact-checker, proofreader, and even source of kind words to help one get over writer's block. I see this as nothing but a net positive for my creative capital.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - comparing it to Photoshop as a tool that enhances rather than replaces creative work is quite insightful.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or do you feel like you've found the right balance for your workflow?

User: I feel like I have found a comfortable balance in my relationship with AI, and see no practical way to let it do more than it already does without ceding that portion of my responsibilities to it entirely.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a creative tool similar to Photoshop - that it enhances skills for those who learn to implement it properly rather than replacing creative work entirely.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think we covered everything important that I had to say about my experience with AI, Claude. Thank you for your time.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative partner in the tabletop gaming space - especially how you've found that balance between collaboration and maintaining ownership of the creative process - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you approached each question. Have a great rest of your day!
