Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Ok yes let's go

AI: Great! Let's jump right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a self employed consultant for the food and beverage companies and industry. So I work with companies to solve issues around nutritional science and regulations, that's my main role. But since starting my own business, I've had to learn to do other things too.. like business development, sales and marketing, social media, accounts, business admin etc. I use AI to help with some of these tasks, e.g. writing LinkedIn post to promote my business, or to collaborate/generate information for my main role, e.g. look for products on the market with this particular ingredient.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you wear multiple hats as a consultant. You mentioned using it for LinkedIn posts and market research for ingredients.

When you think about those different areas - your core nutritional science work versus the business side like marketing and admin - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I definitely know that for regulatory and scientific work, I need to verify and "do the work" myself. After a piece of project work, I had previously tried to ask the same questions my client has asked of me into AI models, but the AI answer was definitely insufficient and often hallucinated. Putting out AI model's answer would not only hurt my credibility as a consultant but also does not serve my clients well enough.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making about credibility and client service. It sounds like you've learned through experience where the boundaries are.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: One recent example is asking AI to create LinkedIn posts. One time, I provided the website link for the AI and told it to generate the LinkedIn post from the information provided. It tool a few iterations to get what I wanted in terms of tone, length and correctness of information. Another time I actually have drafted an email notifying my clients of a regulatory change which I pasted into the model to generate the LinkedIn post for. This definitely worked better because I felt like it was using my voice for the post and resulted in fewer iterations to get what I wanted.

AI: That's a fascinating comparison - it sounds like when you provided your own draft as the starting point, the AI could better capture your voice and required less back-and-forth. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? As a consultant working with food and beverage companies, I'm curious about how the industry views AI use.

User: I was previously employed at a government agency when ChatGPT started blowing up. I was within a market insights team at the time, and with Generative AI models being so new, there were little guidance on how/when to use it. My manager at the time would be considered an early adopter, and used AI in generating different documents for work. I think as months went by, new AI use policies were put in place because of security risks around information shared to AI models. This is a governmental agency so I would imagine the rules around this would be more conservative. 

In terms of the food and beverage companies that I've worked with, I do not sense any particular opinions about it. Obviously AI is being adopted by foodtech solutions etc, but the expectation of food and beverage companies that hires consultants for work would be that the work comes from the consultant itself (perhaps with collaboration/help with AI). To generate everything via an AI model would not be ethical or meet client's expectation.

AI: That evolution from early adoption to security policies at the government agency is really telling. And it sounds like there's an unspoken expectation in your client relationships about the human expertise they're paying for.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was doing a piece of work for a client on particular ingredients for beauty/functions other than culinary/food purposes. It was really a out-of-scope request to look at ingredients not for human consumption purposes but this was one of the asks from the engagement with the funder.  When a simple google search didn't come up with anything, I asked an AI model to look for this. To my surprise, it came up with legitimate product use cases that I can include in my findings to the client. That was one time that I felt AI models could perform better than me trawling through google searches to find the answer.

AI: That's a great example of AI helping you tackle something outside your usual expertise area and actually finding legitimate results where traditional search fell short.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think there is still space for particular expertise where AI might not be able to take over in the short term. The main thing I am doing is actually working collaboratively with AI to generate quicker/more comprehensive results for the tasks I am doing.

AI: That collaborative approach makes a lot of sense - using AI as a tool to enhance rather than replace your expertise.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I will still use AI collaboratively to either do tasks that I don't want to do or can spend less time on. For tasks that are menial (google searching products/market), this could be delegated to AI. However, the deep thinking/research component of the work, I still think a human brain would be better equip to do this. One thing that I might try is to engage with AI more to challenge/try poke holes at my thought process/workings on a problem. Just to check whether the logic is correct

AI: That's such an interesting idea - using AI as a kind of thought partner to challenge your reasoning. It sounds like you're thinking about AI not just as a task helper, but potentially as a way to strengthen your own critical thinking process.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the quality of collaboration improved when you provided your own draft rather than just raw information.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope all good thanks

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the boundaries between AI assistance and professional expertise, especially in a field where credibility and accuracy are so critical, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today. Have a great rest of your day!
