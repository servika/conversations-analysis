Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I do not.

AI: Perfect. Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently, I use AI to help craft or rewrite emails or responses to patient.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you work in healthcare. Tell me more about that. What specifically are you looking for when you have AI help with those emails or patient responses?

User: I use it to help deliver a subject matter than can be perceived in a certain way and I do not want it to be received like that. I also want to be direct but approachable in my delivery.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - managing tone while being direct can be really challenging, especially when dealing with sensitive patient communication. 

Can you walk me through what that process looks like for you? How do you typically work with AI to get that balance of directness and approachability just right?

User: I typically tell AI what I am wanting to say and how I want the tone to be for either my patients or my staff that works under me.

AI: So you're using it for communication with both patients and your staff. When you give AI those instructions about what you want to say and the tone you're aiming for, what happens next? Do you usually take what it gives you as-is, or do you find yourself making adjustments?

User: I would say it is about 50-50. Sometimes I will make some minor adjustments on my own so it sounds more natural and sometimes I will ask AI for a bit of adjustment in tone.

AI: That's really helpful to understand your back-and-forth process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to handle patient phone calls or messages that are related to their symptoms as I do not want something missed that could be detrimental to the patient. I do wish AI could help with gathering patient information or their intake so we can streamline it faster to when the patient is checked in to when they are ready to be seen by the provider.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - keeping the clinical assessment and symptom evaluation in your hands while seeing potential for AI to help with the administrative side. 

When you think about that intake process you mentioned, what would that ideally look like? How do you envision AI helping to streamline that flow from check-in to being ready for the provider?

User: When a patient checks in for their appointment they are asked a series of prompts that are related to what the are being seen and evolve as they begin to answer these questions. It would be ideal that it is done verbally as some elderly or others have difficulty navigating technology. If we can eliminate areas were short staffing is a burden it would be wonderful. I also schedule surgeries and it would be nice if AI can code the surgery's and obtain authorization from the insurance company.

AI: That paints a vivid picture - you're dealing with staffing challenges while trying to maintain quality care. The verbal intake system you described sounds like it could really help with accessibility too.

When you use AI for communication now - crafting those emails and responses - how would you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it all your requirements upfront and have it handle the task more independently?

User: I try to give it as much info upfront and then go back and forth as needed.

AI: That makes sense - start with a clear foundation and then refine as needed. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your practice using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: Most in my practice do not know how to use it or the extent of how it can help.

AI: So you're somewhat of a pioneer in your practice when it comes to AI use. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I don't recall a frustrating experience. I am satisfied when it helps me answer patients' questions and decreases the time it would normally take me to do it myself.

AI: That time-saving aspect sounds really valuable, especially in a busy healthcare setting. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, particularly when it comes to communication or other tasks where you're finding AI helpful?

User: I consider it all the time and try to think of new ways in which it can help improve efficiency in the office.

AI: It sounds like you're constantly exploring new possibilities. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see the biggest opportunities for change in your practice?

User: Biggest opportunities would be patient intake and processing clean billing claims to insurance companies to maximize reimbursement.

AI: Those are really concrete areas where AI could make a significant impact on your practice operations.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've clearly identified where you want to maintain direct control - like patient symptom assessment - while recognizing where AI could streamline administrative processes.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for communication while maintaining clinical judgment, and your vision for streamlining intake and billing processes, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's clear you've thought carefully about where AI fits best in healthcare workflows, and your perspective as someone leading AI adoption in your practice is really valuable. Thanks again for participating in this interview.
