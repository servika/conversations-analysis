Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm part of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's proceed.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for productivity purposes and to research.  For productivity, I will ask AI how to perform certain tasks in Excel to see if there are faster ways to perform certain function in Excel since I am self taught.  I will also see if there are ways to get software tips on software I use to train on since my computer recently crashed and I don't have a live version to perform step by step help.  I am still proficient so that I can do most service calls off of memory.  For research, I will use AI to compile list of prospects, but I have seen challenges in that regard.

AI: Tell me more about those challenges you've encountered when using AI to compile prospect lists. What specifically has been difficult about that?

User: The AI models I use will tell me the source or what it believes to be the best source for information, but will not assimilate it for me which is what I was looking for.  This is frustrating since I think I already have the best source for the information, but I would like the AI to arrange it for me.  An example of this is I asked the AI for a list of schools in a certain school district along with their phone numbers.  Instead the AI explained the list involved over 100 schools and that schools change frequently and the best source was the school district.  So that request for search was frustrating as it yielded nothing I could use to compile information.  I still had to get it or have a person compile it for me.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - you already knew where to find the information but wanted help organizing it. When you encounter those limitations with AI, what do you typically do next? Do you end up doing that compilation work yourself or finding other ways to get it done?

User: I have someone else on the team compile it.  The work is long and tedious and seemed like a perfect item for AI to put together.

AI: That makes complete sense - it's exactly the kind of repetitive, time-consuming work that seems ideal for AI assistance. 

I'm curious about your Excel productivity use that you mentioned earlier. When you ask AI for tips on faster ways to do things in Excel, how does that typically work out? Do you find yourself incorporating those suggestions into your regular workflow?

User: Yes, if the tip is correct and works for me, then I will incorporate the suggestion.  An example of this is transcribing names from one column to a new column so that everything is capitalized, empty cells are deleted, and have a third column compiled where all the values are correct in the third column so that I can delete the first two and have one clean column.  In the past, the third column yields reference error codes when I performed it the self taught way.

AI: That's a great example of AI helping you solve a real technical problem. It sounds like AI was able to give you a method that avoided those reference errors you were getting before.

When you're working through these Excel challenges with AI, do you typically take the suggestion and try it right away, or do you tend to go back and forth with follow-up questions to make sure you understand it fully?

User: I will test the suggestion on dummy files to see if I am getting the correct information or displayed how I want.  I then test it and ask the AI follow up questions like why is that method better than another.  I will ask is that the best way.  There is back and forth with testing the suggestion and testing the AI to make sure we are both on the same page.

AI: That testing approach sounds really methodical - using dummy files first, then having that back-and-forth to understand the reasoning behind the suggestions. 

You mentioned "testing the AI to make sure we are both on the same page." Can you tell me more about what that looks like? What kinds of follow-up questions help you determine if the AI really understands what you're trying to accomplish?

User: I might share with the AI what my ultimate goal is with the "final column".  I will ask if the current suggestion or tip is the best way or if there alternate ways.  I do like to know alternate ways just in case I run into issues.  When I say we are both on the same page, I feel it is important that the AI understand what my goal is so that it can best help with my goals.  It won't always turn out to be the case, but I think if you are using AI as a collaborator, it helps if it is aware of the reasons behind the questions or methods.  Again, I might ask the AI if I delete certain columns will I lose any information.  Before deleting anything, I make a backup of the original anyway, since I don't want to lose a bunch of information due to a misunderstanding.  I also might ask the AI if there is a way to implement a condition where if a name is a certain number of characters that we highlight it so that I can take a better look at it.  In my job we have some long names that if they are too long can impact the entire project.

AI: That's really insightful - you're treating the AI as a collaborator by sharing your broader context and goals, not just asking for quick fixes. It sounds like you've developed a pretty sophisticated working relationship with AI.

When you think about the tasks you handle in your work, are there certain types of things you prefer to keep doing yourself, even though AI might be able to help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to keep doing emails for the personal replies to customers.  I might ask for suggestions on how to phrase certain emails and then I will evaluate its suggestions and use its final copy or drafts as inspiration.  I will still generate the emails.  I don't think I trust it to send information to customers yet.  That might take a while.  I hear from colleagues that they can tell when email correspondence is AI generated and they have a slightly negative regard for sender.  They feel slighted that the sender is "too lazy" to send them a personal note and push it onto AI to do it.  Right or wrong, that is their perception and don't want to fall into that trap and garner that negative vibe.

AI: That's a really thoughtful consideration - balancing the efficiency AI could provide with maintaining those personal relationships and avoiding negative perceptions. It sounds like you've heard some pretty direct feedback from colleagues about AI-generated emails.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture more broadly influenced other ways you use AI in your work? Do people talk openly about using these tools, or is it more of an individual choice?

User: In my workplace, people do not openly talk about using AI tools for work.  It seems like most just use it for searching things instead of googling it.

AI: So it sounds like there's not much open conversation about AI use - people are kind of figuring it out on their own. You seem to have developed a more sophisticated approach than just using it for search.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The frustrating part about AI is something I shared earlier.  Declining to help me with my request on phone numbers for a list of schools.  I am not looking for a list like that to be generated in 3 seconds.  I would be fine if it took a few hours and that the AI could notify me when it is done.  It is frustrating when the AI punts on a requests and basically gives the feedback that it is a lot of work.  No kidding, that's why I was trying to get the AI's assistance.

AI: That's such a clear example of where the current limitations really hit - when AI essentially says "this is hard work" which is exactly why you wanted help in the first place. 

On the flip side, what about a time when using AI felt particularly satisfying? Was there a moment when it really delivered in a way that made you think "yes, this is exactly what I needed"?

User: I think the best consistent example is when I want to do a marketing email.  While it is not a blast in the traditional sense, everyone is getting the same basic message, but I tailor the email to each specific user by including certain aspects of their organization like color or characteristic that is specific to them.  I get the AI's help in framing marketing emails and use it as inspiration.  This helps in phrasing things correctly, not repeating similar words, and sounding professional all at the same time.

AI: That's a great example - using AI to help craft the framework while you add the personal touches that make each email specific to the recipient. It sounds like you've found a sweet spot where AI handles the structural and language aspects while you maintain the personal connection.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No, I don't actively consider that.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future?

User: I am hoping that AI evolves so that it can assist me with productivity.  I think we are still at a point where AI can't help me with some aspects that I like.  I am not sure if it is due to capacity issues or training.  I am hoping I can use AI more to assist me at my job so that I can be more productive for customers.  I feel that greater productivity could free some time to prospect on new customers.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on treating AI as a collaborator by sharing your broader goals and context, and how you've navigated the balance between efficiency and maintaining personal relationships with customers.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. That was it. Thanks

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaboration approach, the challenges with task limitations, and how workplace culture influences AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
