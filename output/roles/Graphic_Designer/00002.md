Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Hi, sounds good! Let's get started.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Well I'm a Graphic Designer, there are multiple different projects depending on the day. I've created many powerpoint templates for my job, worked on logos, and generally just try to keep the brand image consistent throughout different types of media.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse range of work - from PowerPoint templates to logos to brand consistency across different media. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: So typically I find myself asking for help when it comes to brainstorming. I'll have a general idea of what I want to do, but look to AI to see if there are any possible enhancements. I'll also sometimes find myself using it to sort of check my work. I'll feed it my ideas and see if there is anything I'm overlooking. Generally if I'm really stuck somewhere I might use it as inspiration to move forward in the project in a way I hadn't previously thought of.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI more as a brainstorming partner and a sounding board rather than for the actual design execution. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yeah, as far as using it for brainstorming or a soundboard, I feel as though the work would come off as inauthentic if I used it for any of the actual design execution. It feels as there would be a sense of plagiarism and AI created art rather than human design. A recent project that comes to mind was dealing with the creation of a logo for a client. I had several mock up designs and wanted to figure out how to best match the brand identity. Asking Ai how switching certain color palettes might shift brand perception and creating a dialogue, asking it questions such as if a minimalist approach could have the same impact as serif-forward direction in the emotional aspects of the design. It felt like discussing the project with a well educated coworker.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction you're making between using AI for strategic thinking versus execution. You mentioned it felt like discussing the project with a well-educated coworker when you were exploring those color palette and typography decisions.

When you're having those dialogues with AI about brand perception and design direction, how would you describe who's driving the creative decisions? Is it more like you're the director getting input, or does it feel more collaborative than that?

User: I'd say I feel more like a director getting input. While it's definitely more casual than this in a typical sense, I do feel as though I already have the specific vison that the model is helping me work through. It's answering my questions and I'm certainly the one going through all the work. It's more collaborative in a sense, but not on an equal level.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're maintaining creative control while leveraging AI's ability to help you think through different aspects of your vision.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: It's definitely sped things up for me. In the past it would take a while to pull information from scattered sources. AI is there as a sort of all in one source of information. What I might have Googled and sorted through pages of information to find can now be answered in a quick question or two.

AI: That efficiency gain sounds really valuable - having that consolidated source instead of hunting through multiple resources.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I think the main concern with AI in the art field in general is people using it instead of their own creative images. AI art is a growing problem in the sense of inauthenticity.

AI: That concern about authenticity really connects to what you mentioned earlier about feeling like using AI for actual execution would be plagiarism. 

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: As a tool, I see AI being used for similar things that I use it for now. I think the brainstorming help it provides is very useful. I think it can evolve a bit and play more of a role as an educator for a new grad or someone starting out a getting a feel for the work for the first time.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your clear distinction between using AI as a strategic thinking partner versus for actual design execution, and how you maintain that sense of authenticity in your work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think everything has been covered!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a brainstorming partner while maintaining creative authenticity, and your perspective on how it's streamlined your research process, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached this balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving the human creative vision in your work. Have a great rest of your day!
