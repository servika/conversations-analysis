Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me, and I don't have any questions!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I have recently started doing property paralegal work in the UK. I finished a law conversion degree recently and so, whilst I have a foundational understanding of law, there are a lot of nuances that I need help with. So in my typical workday, I will use AI under three different use cases. 1) To help me research a topic. For example, recently I had to find out how a "structure" is defined in law and if there was any statute/case law that might imply that a road could be a structure (there was not unfortunately). 2) I will use AI in order to help me draft work. This can range from emails to ensuring that property transfer documents are correctly worded. 3) This ties in to the above, but I also find it really useful to check over my work and to point out if something doesn't make sense/if I have missed something. I guess it just gives me extra confidence when I send out my work.

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like you're using AI as both a research assistant and a quality control partner in your new role. 

When you mentioned using AI to help with research like the "structure" definition question - can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? Do you start with AI and then verify elsewhere, or do you use it alongside other research methods?

User: So I actually started with a book on restrictive covenants. The book seemed to gloss over what is defined as a structure so I turned to AI. If there is a book then I would be more inclined to get the information from that first (or even ask a colleague), but then I would still check it over with AI. However, this can depend on the information I need to look up. If it is definitions then books work just fine whereas if it is specific case law then AI is a lot more useful in my opinion. 

So to sum up, I would start with a book/colleagues if it is a simple look up question, but for more complex topics I would  use AI. That being said, I would always externally verify what the AI said as it's answers can be a little unreliable.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using different tools based on the complexity and type of information you need. You mentioned that AI can be "a little unreliable" and that you always verify externally.

Tell me more about that verification process. What does that look like in practice, and have there been instances where you caught the AI giving you incorrect information?

User: So the road/structure example I gave earlier is useful here. The AI I was using kept on giving me "examples" of where a structure was defined, including specific sections in statute, however all of these were wrong. It also gave a legal case which it claimed defined whether a road was classed as a structure but, after reading through the case, it did not. When it comes to these legal questions, it can be verify good on general legal questions i.e. what do these covenants mean, but I find it very unreliable when the questions are more nuanced.

As for the verification process, I ask the AI to provide a source for each claim and then I will go and view the webpage to check that it actually says what the AI claims it says.

AI: That's a perfect example of how AI can be confidently wrong about specific details. It sounds like you've developed a healthy skepticism around AI's precision with legal sources.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you'd often start with books or colleagues first - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself entirely, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I would say that I prefer to handle my day's structure by myself. Whenever I have asked AI to help give structure to a day and plan it out, I feel like it never fully understands different priorities and how time intensive some tasks can be.

I would also say that I like to try and draft things first to get a good foundational basis of what I'm after. I don't find AI to be very good at starting tasks, but it is good at helping you refine something once it is already started.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - AI being better at refining than initiating. It sounds like you've found AI struggles with understanding context around priorities and time management, but excels once there's something concrete to work with.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It would always be interaction through a task. There is nothing that I would feel completely happy delegating to AI without some form of oversight. I often start something, ask for the AI's opinion, refine what I am doing, and then go back and forth until I have a refined version that I am happy with. I'll get the AI to proofread the work at the end too.

Just to add to this, I find that I would never copy and paste something directly from AI as it wouldn't be in my voice. When I use the AI's work, I will always put it into my own words/rephrase it, I never take it verbatim.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth approach makes a lot of sense, especially in legal work where precision and your own voice matter so much.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people generally open about using it, or is there a particular attitude toward AI tools in your office?

User: My colleagues are not interested really. I don't think they fully understand what it can do. They have no issue with me using it, but the attitude is pretty apathetic to it to be honest.

AI: That's interesting - so you're kind of pioneering AI use in your workplace. Given that your colleagues are fairly apathetic about it, do you find yourself being more cautious or deliberate about how you use AI, or does their lack of engagement actually give you more freedom to experiment with it?

User: I would say it gives me freedom to experiment with it, but I do find myself being cautious with it too. This is why I make sure to fact check everything it says so that I am still being thorough with my job, but I am also getting work done quickly. Regarding the experimentation, I can use it on pretty much any topic I want to so I do have a wide range of freedom there.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Just from this week, I used it to double check some slightly complex SDLT calculations that I had made. The workings out I had done were fairly rough and all over the place but the model compiled it nicely into a summary which I was able to send to my boss and then to our client. That was a satisfying one.

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like AI really helped you transform rough work into something client-ready. The presentation and organization aspect seems valuable.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you're developing your career in property law?

User: I think it could really help me to develop my skills however there is the concern that I will become over-reliant on it. So I would like to see it as a tutor who is helping me through my work more than an assistant who is actually doing all of the work for me.

AI: That's a thoughtful way to think about it - AI as tutor rather than assistant. That distinction suggests you're trying to learn from the interactions rather than just get tasks done.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving as you gain more experience in property law?

User: It really depends on the element of trust. If I can give details to an AI to draft documents then that would be great. However, I would always manually review any documents it drafted. This would be a longer term goal though as I would like to learn how to do these things myself first so that I am confident when reviewing the AI's work.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a tutor rather than an assistant, and how you've developed such a systematic approach to verification given AI's unreliability with legal sources.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that is everything!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing that collaborative workflow, the importance of verification in legal work, and thinking about AI as a tutor rather than just a task-completion tool will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable hearing how you've navigated being an early adopter in a workplace that's still figuring out AI's role. Best of luck with your property law career!
