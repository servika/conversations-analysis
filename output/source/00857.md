Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to help automate certain tasks within my job. For example, I would ask AI to create a script that I can use within Excel that filters out certain values I am looking for in a table with tons of information.

AI: That sounds like a practical way to handle large datasets. Tell me more about that - when you're working with these Excel scripts, what does that process typically look like for you from start to finish?

User: I copy and paste the script that AI creates for me, and put it into Excel where it creates a button I can select that can filter out what I want from the dataset.

AI: That's a really efficient workflow. So it sounds like you're getting a complete solution from AI that you can implement right away. 

I'm curious - are there other types of work tasks beyond Excel automation where you find yourself turning to AI, or is data filtering and analysis your main use case?

User: I also ask AI questions whenever I am confused about certain topics

AI: That makes sense - using AI as a resource when you need clarification. 

Can you walk me through what that looks like? When you're confused about a topic, how do you typically approach asking AI about it?

User: Usually I would ask AI what I am confused about and also search up on the web, and if they both match I know the response is most likely good quality

AI: That's an interesting verification approach - cross-referencing AI responses with web searches. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I do like working on creative tasks where I challenge my brain to think of innovative solutions on my own, even though I believe AI could do it faster and better most of the time. I do this because I like challenging my brain and feel very lazy and unmotivated if I use AI for creative creation

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making between different types of tasks. It sounds like there's something important to you about maintaining that creative challenge.

When you say you feel "lazy and unmotivated" if you use AI for creative work - can you tell me more about what that experience is like for you?

User: Well I feel like I begin to rely too much on AI and dont think about solutions myself. Almost like I am making someone else do all the work for me

AI: That's a really thoughtful way of thinking about it - maintaining your own problem-solving abilities. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I usually collaborate with it throughout a task

AI: Can you give me an example of what that collaboration looks like in practice? How do you and AI work together on a task?

User: Well like the excel example, AI will create the foundation of the script, and I would make small edits and finalize the script before using it

AI: That's a helpful example - so you're taking that initial foundation and refining it to fit your specific needs.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: They dont use much AI currently, which influences me to use it more so I can be innovative and efficient compared to everyone else by incorporating AI

AI: That's an interesting dynamic - using AI as a competitive advantage. It sounds like you see yourself as kind of an early adopter in your workplace.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Whenever I would program and ask AI how I should approach this problem, it gives a very strong blueprint for me to follow which left me very satisfied

AI: That satisfaction with getting a strong blueprint is really interesting. You mentioned earlier that you like to challenge yourself on creative tasks - it sounds like programming feels different to you than those creative challenges.

What makes programming feel like a good fit for AI collaboration versus those creative tasks where you prefer to work independently?

User: programming is like solving a question from homework. when i am stuck i like asking ai to give me a head start. compared to creative innovative ideas like product making, i dont like just copying what AI says but rather want to think of them myself

AI: That's a really clear distinction - programming as more of a problem with a solution versus creative work where the thinking process itself is valuable to you.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: For those skills, I actively think how I can tie in my skills with the AI so I can work together, as I know AI will potentially take over and do it better

AI: That's a strategic way to think about it - finding ways to complement AI rather than compete with it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it will be a positive thing as I can interact with AI and use it as a help rather than being completely replaced

AI: That's a really optimistic outlook - seeing AI as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between leveraging AI's efficiency while preserving the personal satisfaction you get from creative problem-solving.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope thank you

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you strategically choose when to collaborate with AI versus when to maintain your own creative process will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
