Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, go ahead

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I write creative fiction. Up to now it's been flash fiction and short stories, and I've won awards for some of them. Now I'm working on my first full-length novel.

AI: That's wonderful - congratulations on the awards! Flash fiction and short stories are such distinctive forms, and now tackling a full-length novel must feel like quite a shift.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: One thing I will never use AI for is getting it to write or re-write a section of text for me as that's no better than employing a ghost writer and I'd feel a fraud. I will never lift an entire paragraph of text from AI and put it into my work. 
What I do use AI for is discussing some more technical aspects of writing. This might be as simple as the placement of a comma in a sentence, or as complex as shifting points of view between chapters of a novel. I might also use it for brainstorming ideas.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you've drawn between what feels authentic to you versus what would feel like cheating. I'm curious about those technical discussions you have with AI.

Can you describe a specific recent example where you used AI to work through one of these technical writing aspects? What was that conversation like?

User: Sure. I was grappling with POV in the early stages of my novel. I was writing in first-person POV but events were happening around the country (riots, looting, society breaking down). I was struggling with how I could describe those events in detail as the protagonist couldn't be at all these places around the country and I was wary of having an omniscient narrator.

AI: That's such a classic challenge in first-person narratives - that tension between what your protagonist can realistically witness and the broader scope of events you want to convey.

Tell me more about how you worked through that with AI. What kind of solutions or approaches did it suggest, and how did that conversation help you think about the problem?

User: It suggested various ways of describing second-hand accounts, e.g. news, social media, eye witness accounts, rumours, footage, etc. As it happened, my protagonist is a reporter which lends itself quite well to this. The person he's interviewing can be relating what he's seen in vivid detail to the protagonist - so I still get the "show don't tell" without the protagonist being there himself.
It did also suggest I gave it a section of my text for it to re-write in a more immersive way, but as already mentioned, that's not something I do.

AI: That's a perfect example of how your reporter protagonist opens up those storytelling possibilities! And I appreciate how you stayed true to your boundary even when AI offered to rewrite text directly.

When you're having these technical discussions with AI, how would you describe that dynamic? Who's driving the creative decisions in those conversations?

User: Definitely me. I come with some clear ideas about my work-in-progress and there are certain approaches I do/don't want to take.

AI: That sense of maintaining creative control sounds really important to you. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI as this kind of technical sounding board?

User: I'm not sure aspects of my creative work has changed, as such. AI is just another tool for when I need to work through a problem. Before I might have googled something and read blog posts or something. Now I'll have a conversation with an AI model. But the end result is that I find the answers to my questions and use that to shape my writing.

AI: That's a really helpful way to think about it - AI as another research tool in your toolkit rather than something that's fundamentally changing your process. You're still the one asking the questions and making the decisions.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of creative writing?

User: In the field in general, I'm super concerned about the use of AI to write stories and design book covers. I see it so often now - even writing contests have clauses in their terms to strictly forbid the use of AI. Why is this a concern? Because the quality isn't there. A novel written by AI might have a great plot and be technically brilliant. But it won't have the deeper nuances that only a human can weave throughout the story - the slow burn emotional response a reader might feel from reading a book by an accomplished author.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - between technical competence and those deeper, more nuanced human elements that resonate emotionally with readers. The fact that writing contests are having to explicitly ban AI submissions really speaks to how widespread this has become.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think the way you use it as a technical advisor will change?

User: I would expect to be able to feed it a longer piece of text (maybe even a whole novel, c.80,000 words) and have it critique it (again, critique, not re-write). I would expect it to be better at identifying plot holes, one-dimensional characters, breaking POV, etc. 
Whether I would actually use it for that is a different matter. I would find the advice useful, I'm sure. But I'm not sure I'd be comfortable uploading a finished piece of work of that length to a model.

AI: That's really interesting - you can see the potential value in having AI analyze your full manuscript for structural issues, but you have reservations about actually sharing that much of your work. Can you tell me more about what makes you uncomfortable about uploading a finished piece?

User: Because I don't know how the model will use that material. Someone else could come along saying "I want to write a novel about a reporter dealing with society breaking down" and the model might give my entire story to them.

AI: That makes complete sense - the uncertainty around data usage and potential replication of your unique work is a real concern, especially with something as personal and substantial as a full novel.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated how clearly you've defined your boundaries - using AI as a technical advisor and research tool while maintaining complete ownership of the actual creative writing, and your concerns about quality and authenticity in the broader field.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative integrity while selectively leveraging AI as a technical resource will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. Best of luck with your novel!
