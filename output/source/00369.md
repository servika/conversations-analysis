Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. We may begin.

AI: Great, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I started using AI mostly to write letters of recommendation for me. I write approximately 25 letters of recommendation every February and March. Then, I started using AI to get new math problems for quizzes and tests. I do have difficulty with this, since the problems are often wrong or not what I am looking for from the AI.

AI: That's really interesting - sounds like you're an educator working with recommendations and math problems. 

Tell me more about the difficulty you mentioned with the math problems. What specifically goes wrong when you're trying to get problems from AI?

User: When I ask for problems similar to problems that I already have, there are often math mistakes in the problems that are created or the answers that are given. I am trying to save time by using AI, and often this will end up taking me more time than if I just rewrite the problems myself.

AI: That sounds frustrating - you're looking to save time but end up spending more time checking and fixing the AI's work. 

When you compare this experience with writing recommendation letters, how does that process go differently for you?

User: AI is amazing at writing letters of recommendation. I just enter in what I want to say about a student, and I get a well written, complete letter. If there is anything I don't like about the letter, I can just ask AI to take that out and fix it. It used to take me hours to write a single letter of recommendation. Now I can write them in about 10 minutes each.

AI: That's quite a contrast - 10 minutes versus hours for recommendation letters, but math problems actually taking longer. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I like to use AI to do tasks that I don't enjoy doing on my own. I love designing instruction, so I expect a lot from AI with the design, and I'm hoping that it gives me a better option that what I can come up with. However, since it's my area of expertise, I often find I don't like what AI suggests. However, when I find something I don't enjoy doing, and AI actually does it better, I love using AI to get it done.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - using AI for tasks you don't enjoy versus your areas of expertise where you have high expectations.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I have to interact, because it is rare I get exactly what I am looking for on the first try.

AI: Can you walk me through what that back-and-forth interaction typically looks like for you? What happens after that first attempt when it's not quite what you're looking for?

User: I will ask an AI to rewrite something for me. I tend to be very structured and to the point. AI will write in a way that sounds better. In general, though, I will find a sentence or paragraph that AI made incorrect assumptions about, and I will have to ask the AI to go back and fix it. Once that is done, I generally will go back and adjust the information so that it applies to all of my different classes that I teach. Usually, there will be additional changes to be made based on the class. For example, there will be different directions for Geometry than for Calculus.

AI: That's a helpful picture of your process - starting with AI's improved writing style, then correcting assumptions, then customizing for different classes.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues in the math department have started to use AI more frequently to write letters of recommendation, and they love it for this. They are less likely to attempt to use AI for actual math related material, as they are not as comfortable working with AI as I am.

AI: It sounds like you've become something of a trailblazer in your department when it comes to AI use beyond just the recommendation letters.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Our calculus materials are very old, and I am constantly trying to improve and update the way I teach. There have been times when AI has been incredibly helpful in finding new ideas for instruction, but there have been just as many times when I have tried to find suggestions that will be about a different topic or not related at all to what I am trying to have the AI accomplish.

AI: That mixed experience sounds like it really captures the current reality of working with AI - those moments of breakthrough alongside the frustrations.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really. My job as a math teacher is to build relationships with students and to make mathematics attainable to all. Math is not about finding the answer; it is about building a brain structure in students that will be able to process information and make intelligent, informed decisions. AI is great at finding the answer, but isn't going to build relationships or increase brain advancement in most students. Some kids will be successful using just AI, but most need human interaction to advance and increase their knowledge.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the core purpose of teaching versus what AI can provide.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I am really hoping that AI will allow me to give more immediate feedback to students and the mistakes that they are making. I find with mathematics, if students know they are wrong and can figure out how to fix it quickly, they will advance and improve. I can't do that with 30 students in my class at once. I want students to recognize that they are using AI to help them get better at solving problems, not using AI to get the answer for them.

AI: That vision of AI helping students learn from their mistakes in real-time sounds really promising - using it as a learning tool rather than just an answer-generator.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI fits differently into tasks you enjoy versus those you don't, and your clear vision of teaching as relationship-building rather than just answer-finding.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI in education - from the time-saving success with recommendation letters to the complexities of getting useful math problems - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated how candid you were about both the wins and the frustrations. Have a great rest of your day!
