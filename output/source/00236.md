Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No nothing in particular, all sounds good im ready!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Its not a typical part of the flow, i manage a security checkpoint and so rarely ill use it to note take about unusual situations or to create reminders of certain events that will need to be documented. sometimes ill use it to plan out staff movements, but most of that is something im used to doing so as an experienced manager it ends up being an extra unnecessary step.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI serves more of a documentation role for you rather than being central to your daily operations. 

When you do use it for note-taking about unusual situations, what makes you reach for AI in those moments rather than your usual documentation methods?

User: Mostly out of curiosity - my usual documentation methods that AI is replacing is typically bare lists of employee numbers, times, and the occasional detail in the notes app in my phone. forcing myself to use a conversational format by storing this information in an AI model allows me to recall it better at a later time than a blank list of numbers. Occasionally this is useful, but more often than not i find the extra time spend doing this is not worth it.

AI: That's fascinating - so the conversational format actually helps with your memory and recall, but the time investment doesn't always pay off. 

Can you walk me through what that extra time looks like? What specifically takes longer when you use the AI approach compared to your quick lists?

User: Its the fact that i have to layout what the numbers mean, what the time is for, and the habit of using correct grammar and typing. When i note take in my phone myself, its a raw list of numbers, times, single word references, and then an hour or two later i can read it and remember exactly why i wrote everything down, which usually goes into scheduling software, documentations, and possibly incident reports. To someone else, or frankly even myself a week or two later my intentions are utterly incomprehensible if you were to read the raw number list.

AI: That makes complete sense - your shorthand system works perfectly in the moment but becomes cryptic later, while the AI format is more time-consuming but creates something actually readable down the line.

You mentioned that occasionally this extra clarity is useful but often not worth it. What determines whether that trade-off feels worthwhile to you in the moment?

User: Typically i am under time pressure and stress at work - theres two managers handling about 140 screening officers, and so there is next to no downtime. Taking extra time to do anything on my phone is time taken away from managing screening officers, passengers, lost items, documentations, and at worst case incidents. There is downtime, but its completely unpredictable if i am going to be in a quiet phase for the next 15 minutes or if a flight delay causes an unexpected rush. If i get started in an AI conversation and go through the entire thing without some rush, incident, or customer interrupting me the extra time feels well worth it, but i get interrupted often enough that it ends up feeling quite jarring when not using my shorthand.

AI: That unpredictability sounds really challenging - you never know if you'll have those 15 minutes to complete the AI interaction or if you'll get pulled away mid-conversation.

When you do get interrupted while using AI, what happens to that partially completed documentation? Do you abandon it and fall back to your shorthand, or try to pick up where you left off later?

User: Typically i end up abandoning and going to shorthand. Most interruptions require use of the shorthand, just for different purposes. For lost items, ill jot down lost and found barcode tags, for employee related breaks or incidents, ill take employee or governmental registration numbers, and so once the time pressure is cranked up the shorthand becomes necessary to get things done in satisfactory time.

AI: That shift from AI back to shorthand when the pressure hits makes total sense - you need something that can capture information instantly without requiring your full attention.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: There arent many tasks id prefer to handle myself that AI currently is capable of, basically anything that i think ai can do i would prefer for the AI to do. Flipping around to that, i would really love it if AI could handle employee scheduling, currently i am an operational manager, rather than scheduling, but operationally we need to adjust schedules an absurd amount due to a huge disconnect between paper and reality. I would like it if ai could monitor frequent repetitive schedule changes, highlight them, and then possibly collect a bit more data to see if those changes need to be cemented and made permanent.

AI: That's really insightful - you have a clear preference for AI handling whatever it can, especially those repetitive pattern-recognition tasks like tracking schedule changes.

When you envision AI monitoring those frequent schedule adjustments, how do you picture yourself working with it? Would you want it to present you with recommendations to approve, or would you prefer it to make certain types of changes automatically?

User: Typically its officers themselves coming to me or any other operational manager to approve changes. The role i see for AI is to unite the managers so we all have more of a birdseye view of whats going on checkpoint by checkpoint. We have limits and requirements for total man hours worked, break considerations, and checkpoint by checkpoint staffing, so what id really like ai to do is summarize what is going on so we can at a glance see what the staffing levels are like in theory, then unify that with punch clocks so we can see where officers are in reality. From that, id also like to see recommendations that could be approved in a single click.

AI: That coordination challenge sounds complex - having to juggle theoretical staffing versus actual reality across multiple checkpoints while officers are requesting changes in real-time.

When you think about those single-click recommendations the AI would provide, what would make you trust them enough to approve quickly? What information would you need to see to feel confident hitting that approve button?

User: I would need to see staffing levels, break status of a checkpoint, predictive information on rushes (this could be unified with flight information to create predictions on how many lines we will need open at given times and where those lines need to be), and who is being moved/extended. In theory, everyone is equal, in reality other officers are more efficient and work harder than others, and this also needs to be confirmed on a managers side.

AI: That's a sophisticated system you're describing - balancing the human reality of different officer capabilities against the theoretical equal treatment, while factoring in real-time flight data.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other managers or officers have different approaches, or is there any organizational guidance around AI use?

User: My workplace doesn't integrate AI at all and we have had no references to AI in our stream. I imagine other departments - finance, HR, etc may be utilizing AI but on the actual floor there is next to no use of AI from colleagues or any workplace guidance. My minimal use of AI is by far the most of any other manager to my knowledge, but there are 200 of us and I only directly work with about 80 of them.

AI: So you're essentially pioneering AI use in your immediate work environment - that puts you in an interesting position of experimenting on your own without organizational support or peer examples to learn from.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: My use of AI hasn't been particularly polarizing, but a minor frustration was when i was trying to note take via AI and i got interrupted frequently. My shorthand i was referring to earlier wouldve been done, but i was pushing to get the information down in ChatGPT and i ended up losing track of what i needed to include multiple times, causing a huge time loss (over a longer period of time)

AI: That sounds really frustrating - trying to push through with the AI approach when your instincts were probably telling you to just switch back to shorthand, and then losing your train of thought multiple times because of it.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think it would not impact my skills with scheduling. The actual skill is with knowledge and use of our very bad scheduling program, but if the goal is to replace that with an AI enabled system, the skill becomes redundant, which would be a good thing. Speaking generally, I would put limits to how much of my mind i outsource to AI, particularly with memorization and trust in my own knowledge, its super important to keep that sharp and not depend on AI. There's nothing worse than someone who needs to consult a computer before saying or doing anything as it indicates they as a person are unnecessary in that role and should probably just be replaced with the computer they repeatedly consult.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - being strategic about what to delegate versus what to keep sharp. You're describing a balance between leveraging AI for efficiency while maintaining your core human judgment and knowledge.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Its a highly government regulated sector, so likely my operational stream (which is where most of the regulation focuses on) is going to be completely untouched save for personal use of AI like i have been using it. One day possibly the government (or my company) could decide to invest in an AI based technology to help run things in some way, which i am thinking is becoming more likely by the day. My hope is they target it intelligently - which would be scheduling like ive referenced, but theres a change they could push it only our security procedures, which i think would be a disaster.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the unpredictable nature of your work environment affects when AI tools are practical versus when you need to fall back on your efficient shorthand system.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, i think that does about cover it!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI tools with the realities of a high-pressure, unpredictable work environment - and your thoughtful approach to what should and shouldn't be delegated to AI - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through these details with me today!
