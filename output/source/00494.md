Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Every day, I am assigned articles to plan, write, or edit for multiple clients. I turn to AI soon after receiving my assignments so I can perform some initial research on the article's topic, such as finding 2025 financial statistics for my article's introduction or drafting a quick outline for a new mortgage guide.

AI: That's really helpful context - so you're working as a writer across multiple clients. 

When you mention turning to AI for initial research like finding those 2025 financial statistics, can you walk me through what that process actually looks like for you? How do you typically go about getting that information from AI?

User: I first consider the articles's topic and what types of recent research there might be online for that topic. For example, if I'm writing an article about ways to knock out debt, I'll decide to find a statistic on how much debt the average American has or how many people feel that debt is hindering their ability to reach their goals. Once I have my idea in mind, I craft a prompt that specifically asks for 2025 statistics on that topic from reputable sources, ideally financial institutions and government authorities. The AI usually outputs a list of different options for me, and I go through them to see which is the best fit and verify the accuracy.

AI: That verification step you mentioned is interesting. When you say you "verify the accuracy" of the statistics AI provides, what does that process look like for you? How do you go about checking those sources?

User: Usually, the LLM's response will include links to the sources it used to gather the statistics, so I follow those links to make sure that statistic is actually on the page and isn't misrepresented. I've had some instances where the LLM either misinterpreted the data or miscalculated it. If the statistic checks out, then I use it in my article. Otherwise, I look at the suggested sources the LLM provided and usually still find something helpful to use.

AI: It sounds like you've developed a pretty systematic approach to fact-checking. You mentioned there have been instances where the LLM misinterpreted data or miscalculated - can you tell me more about what happened in one of those situations?

User: Yes, recently I wrote an article about how many Americans were living paycheck to paycheck and specifically asked for 2025 studies. The LLM provided a statistic that seemed reasonable at first, but once I checked the linked webpage, I saw that it was misinterpreting a 2024 study to be for 2025. I was able to find the more recent version of the study and include the current statistic.

AI: That's a great example of how your verification process caught an important error. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your writing work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: While I know that AI is capable of writing full article drafts, I honestly prefer to still create the final piece myself and use AI for research, ideas, and inspiration. Most of my clients also require that I don't submit AI-written drafts, so it's honestly not even a choice for me most of the time. But even if I could submit fully AI drafts, I love using my creativity, so I would still want to play a major role in the content creation process.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there's both a practical constraint from your clients and a personal preference at play. When you talk about loving to use your creativity, can you give me a specific example of what that looks like when you're crafting an article? What part of the creative process feels most important to you?

User: When I'm crafting an article, I usually start with researching the topic online and via LLMs so I can come up with a general understanding. Then, I create an outline based on what the most important aspects of the topic are, and that's where AI has been a huge help for me. I then create my first draft using reliable sources, proofread everything, and sometimes submit my rough draft to AI for suggestions on any gaps in the content. Then, I do a final run-through to smoothen any awkward language, ensure I didn't miss anything from my client's style guide, and then submit once I feel satisfied that I've achieved the client's goals. Of all these steps, I think the planning process is where my creativity is most important since I want to create a piece that is unique and stands out from competitors in the top search results.

AI: That planning process sounds crucial to your work. When you mention wanting to create something "unique and stands out from competitors in the top search results," how do you approach that? What goes through your mind when you're trying to find that unique angle?

User: First, I think about what questions readers might have that the top-performing pages aren't answering or any way I can integrate personal experience or concrete examples to make the topic more applicable to the reader. I've had a past client suggest these types of approaches in an effort to make more human-centered content.

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Most of the time, I am collaborating with the model for research, planning, and revision purposes as I'm working on each of my articles. I rarely fully delegate a task, besides something like drafting feedback for writers based on key findings I noted or sending an email to explain an issue to a client.

AI: That collaboration approach you describe is interesting. When you're working with AI during that research and planning phase, how do you typically structure that back-and-forth? Do you have multiple exchanges with the AI, or is it more of a one-shot request and response?

User: I have multiple exchanges during that phase. For example, if I'm writing about mortgage rates, I might first prompt the AI to give me a rundown of how mortgage rates work and what they are currently. That way, I have a basic understanding of the topic in mind. Next, I'll prompt the AI again to generate an article outline based on the goals that I or my client has set for the project. Then, I'll likely prompt the AI again to note some important statistics or research to include in the draft.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Many of my colleagues in the journalism field have taken a position against AI since they fear it will take away their jobs. Additionally, many clients limit how we writers and editors are allowed to use AI, often to research and planning. However, my position has been that AI can help me do my job more efficiently, so I want to take advantage of the technology as much as possible.

AI: That's a really interesting dynamic. When you say your colleagues have taken a position against AI out of job concerns, how does that play out in your day-to-day interactions with them? Do you find yourself keeping your AI use more private, or are you open about how you're incorporating it into your workflow?

User: I work remotely, so thankfully my colleagues wouldn't know about my AI use like they would if we were in the office. I do keep it more private, mainly because I've heard of other writers being falsely accused of generating their articles with AI, even though they wrote the drafts themselves.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Recently, I had to write a content brief for an article topic that doesn't have much traction yet on the web, so I find it a bit of a nightmare not being able to do a true competitor analysis since articles didn't yet exist. AI saved my day since it was able to give me an outline of what were the key points to address. From there, I could do further research to create a more thorough outline.

AI: That sounds like AI really came through for you in a challenging situation. On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI left you feeling frustrated? What happened in that case?

User: Yes, I needed to include a complex mortgage payment calculation in an article that discussed how much a person would need to earn to afford a home.  I kept getting contradicting numbers since the AI was making various assumptions, such as the interest rate and down payment, and it also seemed to ignore that personal finance factors come into play. Honestly though, this problem would be hard even for a seasoned professional, but it was frustrating.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have definitely started focusing on improving my domain-specific knowledge and tech skills. I have a financial and tax background with some computer science skills mixed in, and I find myself interested now in more technical topics, such as data analysis and coding.  I do feel uncertain about the future overall, but I hope to still provide value to employers and clients.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I believe that my clients will become more open to allowing writers to use AI to create drafts and that my role could shift more toward AI editing and fact-checking than simply writing articles.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed that systematic verification process to catch AI errors, and how you're proactively building skills in more technical areas.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, nothing at this time. Thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing collaboration with AI while maintaining creative control, navigating workplace dynamics around AI use, and adapting your skill development have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
