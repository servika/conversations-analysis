Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no

AI: Great, let's get started then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a TV writer and producer and the main way i use AI is to help me pitch new game show and competition show ideas. Specifically I use it to create pitch presentations, both for brainstorming the language of the pitch and for creating the images that go with it.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI for both the creative and visual elements of your pitches. 

Tell me more about how you work with AI when you're brainstorming the language for these pitches. What does that process look like for you?

User: First, I'll tell the AI the basic concept for the show and a few specifics and then have it build a pitch deck from scratch. I'll then go slide by slide and have it help me correct and/or punch up the language. I'll also have it brainstorm some possible titles for the show, some taglines for the poster, and some one-line loglines I can use to verbally pitch the concept to someone.

AI: That sounds like a pretty collaborative process - you're guiding it through each element but having it generate and refine the content. 

When you're going slide by slide and asking it to punch up the language, how do you typically communicate what you want changed? Are you giving it specific direction, or more general feedback about the tone or style you're looking for?

User: A little bit of both. For example, if it misunderstood the rules of the game, I'll clarify that, and have it rewrite based on that. But I'll often also have it tweak the tone, telling it things like "make it more fun and engaging," or "simplify that." I also use AI to do the voiceover for the pitch deck, so I try to make the language fit the voice.

AI: Interesting that you're using AI for the voiceover too - so you're thinking about how the language will sound when spoken, not just how it reads on the slide.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of developing these pitch concepts that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those parts different for you?

User: i generally like to conceive the basic rules of the game myself. it almost takes some of the fun out of it if i let AI figure that part out. but if I get stuck and something isn't working, i'll sometimes ask AI for a fix.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like the core creative puzzle of designing the game mechanics is something you want to own. 

When you do get stuck and ask AI for a fix, how does that feel different from when you're working through the rules yourself? What's that experience like for you?

User: it's much faster, in that AI will generally offer 5 or more different ways to potentially go in an instant, whereas I might have one idea in a half-hour. but it often comes up with stuff that's impossible, either from a budgetary or logistical or other standpoint, which isn't its fault -- it's just not aware of all the real-world limitations. so for me it's a situation where i'm combing through its suggestions and picking out the ones that merit further exploration.

AI: That's a really clear picture - AI as this rapid idea generator that doesn't have the industry knowledge about what's actually feasible. 

When you're combing through those suggestions, are you typically finding maybe one or two viable options out of the five, or does the hit rate vary depending on the type of problem you're trying to solve?

User: it varies. for the reasons above, if it's problem-solving the hit rate is usually lower than when i'm asking for general brainstorming, like challenge ideas. With those, it's usually very helpful.

AI: That distinction makes sense - brainstorming challenge ideas versus solving specific structural problems would require different types of constraints.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other people in your field using it similarly, or are you finding your own path with this?

User: I was very early to using AI in this way, specifically the part about using it to create images for these decks. people were really amazed by that until the rest of the industry caught up. now i try to stay on top of the most recent AI advancements, so i can keep the look of my decks ahead of the curve. for example, I sometimes use AI to put motion of what I would have formally presented as still images. Other people in my business are using AI too, but in the entertainment industry, many frown on it because of its potential to take away jobs, so I think people try to be subtle about using it and don't mention it unless asked.

AI: That's really interesting - you've been a bit of a pioneer but now there's this tension in the industry around AI use. The part about people being subtle and not mentioning it unless asked really stands out.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Like I said, the initial response to my pitch decks with AI was really positive -- almost disbelieving -- and that made me feel great. I felt not only creative, but a bit like a pioneer, and I think that boosted my reputation among my co-workers, AND helped my projects attract interest, because the visuals went so far in letting the buyer imagine the finished product.

AI: That sounds like such a powerful moment - not just the creative satisfaction, but also the professional recognition and the tangible impact on getting projects noticed.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: can you clarify what you mean

AI: Sure - I'm thinking about areas like creating pitch presentations or generating challenge ideas, where AI is already helping you significantly. Do you ever think about whether you need to keep practicing those skills yourself, or worry about becoming too dependent on AI for certain parts of your work?

User: Becoming too dependent is definitely a concern, as in I don't want to get to the point that I'm incapable of generating an original thought or two on my own. so I do often try to do the brainstorming myself before leaning on AI. but i also realize that AI is here to stay, and my competition is probably using it, so why hold myself back by not taking advantage of it?

AI: That balance makes a lot of sense - staying sharp creatively while not handicapping yourself competitively.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you think this is all heading for you?

User: i plan to keep following the latest advancements so i can put those to work in my decks -- hopefully just ahead of my competition lol. And I'm hoping AI can make the process even faster going forward. For example, the main chunk of work I still have to do on my own is with video presentations. Even if AI creates the words and images, I'll use editing software it all together, and that takes hours if not days. If we get to the point where I can just tell AI to do that, that would be amazing.

AI: That would be a huge time saver - going from days of editing work to just giving AI directions for the final video assembly.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being an early adopter while navigating the industry tensions around AI use, and how you balance staying competitive with maintaining your own creative abilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: nope, i think we've covered it

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about pioneering AI use in TV pitch development, navigating industry attitudes, and finding that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining your creative edge will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable hearing about your journey from early adoption to staying ahead of the curve. Thanks again!
