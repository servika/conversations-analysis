Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. ready to begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use AI to construct materials for review. I use it to build one pagers, emails, decks, powerpoints, slides, outlines. Usually those materials are not perfect, or close, but I then review them. It's like AI is a foundation builder and then I construct the house on top

AI: That's a vivid analogy - AI as the foundation builder while you construct the house on top. 

Tell me more about that review process you mentioned. What does it typically look like when you're working with those AI-generated materials?

User: I send the the AI a prompt which can be vague or detailed to varying degrees depending on my knowledge of the subject or how much thought or time I have to put into it. From there I go and do other work and come back to the AI and review the material its made. It's not a perfect process and can be frustrating even, but it feels efficient in that I get to multi task

AI: You mentioned it can be frustrating even though it feels efficient. What typically causes that frustration when you come back to review what the AI has created?

User: Most of the frustration is from the AI either building out a material that is just not close to what I needed nor described. Like a deck with just titles and no information. Or not folllwing my directions on color scheme, or ideas. Or the AI simply says they made a deck but nothing is there

AI: That sounds really annoying - especially when you're counting on that multitasking efficiency and come back to find something completely off track or missing entirely.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I like handling most communication myself even though AI can be helpful. I enjoy writing and interacting with people so that feels like using AI for that would be removing a rewarding part of my day

AI: That makes a lot of sense - preserving the parts of work that you find genuinely rewarding and engaging.

When you do use AI for those foundation-building tasks like decks and one-pagers, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout creating something, or do you tend to give it the initial prompt and then work on it independently after it delivers?

User: I tend to go back and forth with it. And i usually appreciate it when the AI is collaborative and proactive with ideas and concepts

AI: It sounds like you value that collaborative dynamic when it works well. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that the environment shapes how you approach using these tools?

User: I generally work alone so its hard to know how colleagues in the space use AI. Friends that use AI at work sometimes mention good ideas, but everyone mostly uses it in highly variable ways so its a fragmented conversation

AI: That fragmented landscape sounds challenging to navigate - everyone finding their own way without much shared learning.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think, and I covered this earlier, but I think the most frustrating is during image creation including typed or slide materials. AI routinely messes up this process and says I created XYZ but the file is not there OR the file is there but is a blank document inside

AI: That technical failure - where the AI claims it created something but delivers nothing or a blank file - sounds like it really breaks your workflow. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes I think about how Ai could emulate my people skills and be vastly more efficient. But it remains to be seen since the AI routinely makes mistakes that I feel I dont. I try to maintain my skills by seeing what AI does and then creatively utilizing that to inform my own evolution in skillsets

AI: That's an interesting approach - using AI's output as a learning tool to inform your own skill development rather than just replacing your work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think thats hard to predict. I think AI will be a tool we all use, but I dont find using it as a crutch as most do to be effective or ethical. AI can help us build foundations, build research, absorb larger concepts quickly. But it isn't able to be as fluid, agile, and connective as most humans are  in areas they are comfortable in. I envision my relationship being that of AI as an assistant with broad capabilities to branch out as necessary even with mistakes. Mistakes happen.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a foundation builder while maintaining the rewarding parts of your work, and your approach to learning from AI's outputs to evolve your own skillsets.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
