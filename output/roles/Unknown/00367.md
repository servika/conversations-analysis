Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, I do not have any questions.

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI frequently for generating word documents in the form of military accomplishments and directives. I have also used it to reword certain texts to fit into a criteria I am looking for.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like AI helps you with some pretty specific military documentation. 

When you're working on these military accomplishments and directives, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you approach creating those documents with AI?

User: Typically I have a bulleted list of accomplishments and I ask AI to rewrite them into a narrative with some general parameters in order to create awards for Soldiers. I have also used it to take a few words for accomplishments and generate a couple sentences for the sake of evaluations.

AI: That gives me a clear picture of how you're using it for those award narratives and evaluations.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I typically handle anything with Microsoft Excel and emailing myself. Microsoft Excel because I am not familiar with how to integrate AI into that yet, and emailing because I have a specific style of emailing to be both professional and personable.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like your email style is something you've developed over time and want to maintain control over.

When you are using AI for those military documents - the awards and evaluations - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the task, or do you tend to give it all the information upfront and have it handle the complete task independently?

User: I typically provide the totality of the information in one submission, and then ask for specific rewrites on the different aspects if it doesn't sound quite how I want it to. For example: If I provide it with 10 short bullet points, and ask it to produce 3 langer narrative achievements. I will look at each of the three outputs effectively independent of one another and ask for the rewrites for those I want to have changed.

AI: That's a really methodical approach - giving it everything upfront and then fine-tuning specific pieces as needed.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or approaches within your military environment?

User: I think it is being integrated a lot more now than when it first became available. Others are seeing the benefit of having AI produce some of the repetitive tasks.

AI: It sounds like there's been a shift in acceptance as people see the practical benefits.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI helped me to write an evaluation for one of my Soldiers and it turned out great. The Soldier was very appreciative of the evaluation and using AI made the process much simpler and faster for me.

AI: That's a great example of a positive outcome - both efficient for you and meaningful for the Soldier.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I have looked at different AI options that specialize in different aspects to learn more about how to integrate them into my life.

AI: That's an interesting approach - exploring specialized AI tools to expand your capabilities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Yes

AI: Could you tell me more about that? What changes do you see happening in how you'll work with AI in the future?

User: Using AI to build schedules and eventually more complex outputs such as Microsoft Excel sheets, or Microsoft Powerpoint presentations

AI: That sounds like you're planning to expand into some areas you mentioned earlier - like Excel where you haven't integrated AI yet.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed that methodical approach of providing all the information upfront and then refining specific pieces.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for military documentation, your systematic approach to refining outputs, and how you're seeing increased acceptance in your workplace will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
