Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a teacher, specifically a dance teacher at a public high school. I mainly use AI to make lessons, get lesson ideas or ideas to add to my already planned out lesson, and to generate creative content like social media content.

AI: That's really interesting - I can see how AI would be helpful for both the educational planning side and the creative content creation. 

When you're working on lessons, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? Are you starting from scratch with AI, or are you bringing existing lesson frameworks to it and asking for enhancements?

User: Well, I already know what the unit involves, so I just have it write the lesson plan. I will tell it the topic, grade level, subject, and then that I need an objective, essential questions, what standards it covers, and activities along with assessment. It writes it and I turn it in to administration.

AI: So you're having AI generate the complete lesson plan structure for you. When you get that lesson plan back from AI, do you find yourself making changes to it before you turn it in, or does it typically give you exactly what you need as-is?

User: I make some changes because sometimes the verbiage sounds a bit strange. I also know what the lesson actually entails, so if it has things in there that I don't actually do, I take them out.

AI: That makes sense - you're tailoring it to match both your voice and the reality of what you'll actually be doing in class. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I have to choreograph a lot, so I like to handle that by myself. AI is not great at explaining or generating dance movement, so I do all of that. I do use it to help me with titles though.

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like the physical, embodied nature of choreography is something that really needs your expertise and creativity. 

Tell me more about how you use AI for titles. What's that process like when you're working on naming a piece?

User: I explain the intention of the work and what the music is and maybe describe the movement. I also will tell it sometimes how many words I want the title to be

AI: That's a smart way to leverage AI for that specific aspect. It sounds like you're giving it the creative context but keeping the artistic vision and physical creation in your hands.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate. I will give it the constraints or parameters that I want and see what it generates. Then I will alter it from there.

AI: So you're really using it as more of a collaborative partner - setting the boundaries and then refining what comes back. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other teachers at your school using it, or is there any particular attitude toward AI tools in your environment?

User: Other teachers are definitely using it for lesson plans, as it saves a lot of valuable time. There is concern though about students using it instead of their own work or ideas.

AI: That's an interesting dynamic - teachers embracing it for their own efficiency while being concerned about student use. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfied- lesson plans taking only minutes instead of hours. Also, for our script for our show (the one the emcee reads) used to take me days to write and now it takes me hours. This is such a help. I get frustrated with getting captions for social media, as it usually comes back with very cheesy captions.

AI: That's such a stark contrast - saving literally days on the script work versus the social media captions not quite hitting the right tone. 

When you say the social media captions come back "cheesy," what would you prefer them to sound like instead? What's the voice or style you're going for that AI seems to be missing?

User: I want catchy and sometimes funny. But even when I tell it that, it comes back cheesy.

AI: It sounds like there's a subtle difference between "catchy and funny" versus "cheesy" that AI isn't quite picking up on - maybe it's going too far in trying to be clever or using language that doesn't feel authentic to your voice.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: For the arts, definitely! I think we are safe from it generating movement for now, especially in contemporary. But other artists are worried, like visual arts or music.

AI: That's insightful - it sounds like you see the physical, embodied nature of dance as a protective factor right now, while recognizing the concerns in other artistic fields.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future, or expanding into other areas?

User: I am surprised daily with how much it is advancing. One thing I do a lot is to cut music for our dances. I haven't seen where it can do that yet, so that would be interesting. I have already increased how much I use it for lesson plans and ideas so much in the past year, so I guess that may continue to grow.

AI: That's really interesting - music editing is such a specialized skill that combines technical know-how with artistic timing and flow. It makes sense that would be on your radar as a potential future application.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI fits differently into the creative versus administrative aspects of teaching dance - that distinction between where it saves you valuable time versus where your expertise is irreplaceable.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI integrates into dance education - from the administrative efficiency gains to the creative boundaries - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
