Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's get started!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure thing. AI has a huge variety of uses in my everyday workday. I use the AI that's built into Google Sheets quite often to assist with spreadsheets, organization and overall simplifying a task. I use ChatGPT to answer a lot of questions I might have, which can include anything from general advice, to creating scripts that make things easier. Sometimes, I might even use it to generate photos or branding logos if needed! It's fast, and I subscribe to a plan where I'm not limited by the amount of generations.

AI: That's a really diverse set of applications. It sounds like you're using AI across quite a range of your work activities.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Oh sure, yes. There are some things I'd rather a human do. The main thing here personally is customer service. I know how frustrating it can be to be on the other end of an AI asking endless questions when all you want is to speak to a real person. I don't believe AI is capable of any sort of empathy, and that's sort of required in the customer service field, so I have always and will always do this personally. I think for anything that's a "final draft", whether that's a report or a spreadsheet, I'm always going to triple-check it myself to make sure it's right. It's easy to get things wrong using AI if you aren't VERY specific on what you're trying to achieve, and even then, it's possible for it to make a mistake. What makes this different is the human connection, honestly. It makes all of the difference when you have a frustrated customer trying to resolve their problem quickly.

AI: That human connection piece really comes through in what you're describing. The empathy factor in customer service makes a lot of sense.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Personally, I am WAY more likely to collaborate it with tasks, rather than delegating complete tasks for it to handle independently. AI is great, but like I said, it does make mistakes. It's great for helping and simplifying certain things, but I wouldn't want it to be responsible for 100% of anything.

AI: That collaborative approach makes sense given your emphasis on checking the work. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: That's hard to say, honestly. It's a pretty split crowd when it comes to opinion of AI. Half of the people I know despise AI for it's ability to take away jobs, and streamlining everything too much. The other half are like me, and find it useful in certain tasks during the day! As AI becomes more advanced, I find myself doing more and more to test its limits.

AI: Interesting that you're in an environment where opinions are so divided. You mentioned that as AI becomes more advanced, you find yourself testing its limits more.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes, sure. Recently, I was trying to make a script from scratch that enabled me to submit a task. It was fairly simple, honestly. I wanted the keys on my keyboard to correspond with certain bubble selections, and another key to submit the task when I was done selecting them. However, the script wasn't done properly, and the bubble keys weren't properly selected. It also auto submitted my task before it was complete. As someone who isn't SUPER familiar with scripts, I found this incredibly frustrating. I would have thought something so simple wouldn't have been a hard task for AI to do, but I ended up spending the better part of two hours trying to troubleshoot and make it work with the AI!

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - spending two hours troubleshooting what seemed like it should be straightforward. The auto-submission before completion must have been especially aggravating.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: This is something I think about a lot. It makes the job market a lot more cut-throat. You really have to be active in your area of expertise, and hone in on your skills, otherwise you're at risk of your job being replaced either entirely or partially.

AI: That competitive pressure you're describing sounds quite real. The need to actively stay sharp in your expertise area makes sense.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Personally, I'm not going to stop using it. It has simplified my day-to-day life, both at work and at home. I find myself saying, "Let me ask AI!" a lot of the time when faced with something that confuses me or I'm not as knowledgeable of. And like I said before, I find my interaction with AI increasing as time goes on and they're developed further. It's interesting just how much it can do for you if you use it properly.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that human connection in customer service and your collaborative approach rather than full delegation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's it, thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between AI assistance and human judgment, especially around customer service and the importance of collaboration over delegation, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the frustrations - like that scripting experience. Those real-world details make all the difference in understanding how people actually work with these tools day-to-day.

Thanks again, and have a great rest of your day!
