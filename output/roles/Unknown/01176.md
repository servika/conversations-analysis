Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a freelance 3D creature and character artist, I work primarily in video games and 3D print. Typically, I'll be contracted to take a design or concept someone else made and turn it into a 3D model that is ready to either be animated or 3D printed

AI: That sounds like fascinating work - bringing concepts to life in 3D form. So you're taking someone else's 2D designs and translating them into fully realized 3D models.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Sometimes clients don't have a set design in mind, so I use generative AI to help me brainstorm design ideas. I've also used it to generate alternative angles of pieces if I was only provided with one view. 3D pieces typically need to look good from every angle, but the 2D images I work from only show one, so AI has been helpful to fill in gaps.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI to solve the practical challenge of turning limited reference material into something that works from all angles. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Unfortunately most of my client work is under NDA so I can't discuss a specific project, but I've used AI to help me with personal work, as well. I recently came up with an idea for a D&D character I will be playing in a campaign with some friends, and decided I wanted to sculpt her. I used Photoshop's Firefly to generate a few different ideas of what she might look like, collaged some parts of the images together, and then used the result as a concept for the sculpting.

AI: That's a great example - using it for your personal D&D character project. When you were working through that process of generating ideas with Firefly, then collaging parts together, and finally sculpting from that concept, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what felt like it was driving the creative decisions?

User: Initially it felt like Firefly was trying to take the lead on creativity, but once I started piecing parts of different images together (and painting in some of my own details), it felt like I was the creative force behind the project. The process was very similar to how I typically work, except in the past, I would be doing a lot more googling and searching for royalty-free images to work with. In this case (and with the client work I've used AI on), it feels like I'm able to ask for very specific images to work with instead of digging through thousands of search results. The process of collaging things together to use as a reference is the same either way, Firefly just made it easier to "find" the images I wanted to use.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - that AI made it easier to "find" the specific images you needed rather than changing your fundamental creative process. It sounds like you maintained your role as the creative decision-maker while AI functioned more like an improved search tool.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I don't think much of my process has changed much, outside of the initial brainstorming and concepting phase. Most of my work is 3D and there aren't many useful AI tools for 3D work yet. I've seen a few that seem to be attempting to do the entire 3D modeling process from start to finish with a simple text prompt, but as far as I've seen, none of them would actually be helpful for me, yet. I would love some AI tools that could handle the less creative parts of my work though, like retopology and UV unwrapping!

AI: That's really helpful to hear - so AI has streamlined your reference-gathering phase, but the core 3D work remains very much in your hands. And it sounds like you'd welcome AI assistance with the more technical, less creative tasks.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Currently, I'm mostly concerned that the companies who usually hire 3D artists, like game studios, are under the assumption that AI can do what I do, and have been laying off hundreds of thousands of people in favor of investing in AI tools. I'm not at all worried about AI actually replacing me, just that companies seem to think it can. 

I'm also a little concerned (though more annoyed than concerned) that so many 3D-related AI tools are trying to do the sculpting/modeling and texturing, but the resulting models are such a mess that a human would have to do a ton of clean-up to make them useable. Those tools are seemingly trying to do the fun, creative parts of the work, leaving humans to do the tedious, technical work that we already hate. I want to see more 3D tools aimed at *assisting* a 3D artist, not trying to do our work for us.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making - the difference between what AI can actually do versus what companies think it can do, and the consequences of that misunderstanding. And your point about AI targeting the creative parts while leaving the tedious work to humans is particularly striking.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think in the next few years, as people start to understand the technology a little better, artists will be more likely to adopt some of the more useful tools, and the "generate game-ready assets from a single prompt!" type tools will be more of a fun novelty than anything actually useful. I think there are a lot of specific areas where AI would be incredibly helpful in making the 3D pipeline more efficient without making it feel any less creative, and I think we'll start to see more and more specialized tools to handle small parts of the process rather than a single AI trying to do all of it in one go. 

I personally use at least 3 different software programs on every 3D project, sometimes as many as 7 or 8. It doesn't make much sense to me to have a single generative AI doing all of that from a single prompt, but it absolutely makes sense to use AI to handle parts of it.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - moving from these all-in-one AI solutions toward more specialized tools that integrate into your existing multi-software workflow. It sounds like you see a future where AI becomes more of a sophisticated assistant at specific stages rather than trying to replace the entire creative process.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI functions more like an improved search tool for reference gathering, and your distinction between AI assistance versus replacement - especially the idea that the best AI tools should handle the tedious technical work while leaving the creative decisions to humans.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I am a firm believer that AI can and will be a useful tool in many industries, and artists who are currently concerned about being replaced might be over-reacting for the most part. It reminds me of when Photoshop was first being adopted as an industry standard for art creation, and people who didn't understand how it works were under the impression that the computer is doing all of the work, like you just push a button and it paints a picture. That being said, in some ways, generative AI really is "push a button and it paints a picture." When it comes to art and creativity, I believe anything an AI produces should be treated as a reference or a part of the process, not the final product.

AI: That's a really valuable perspective - the parallel to Photoshop's early adoption is fascinating, and your point about treating AI output as reference material rather than final product gets to the heart of how creative professionals can thoughtfully integrate these tools.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the current disconnect between AI capabilities and industry perceptions, along with your vision for more targeted AI assistance tools, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how candid you've been about both the opportunities and the challenges you're seeing in your field.
