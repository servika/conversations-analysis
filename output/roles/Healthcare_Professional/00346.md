Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, that sounds reasonable.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't personally use AI during my workday, but have seen impact. As a medical transcriptionist, my team recently switched to Microsoft PowerScribe One which substantially shifted the workflow for myself and my team mates on a day to day basis. We no longer transcribe and edit dictated reports, but instead have shifted toward more generalized support. We are still a valuable resource to the radiologists, linking them to patients, providers, and outside hospitals to ensure care is coordinated, but the ways in which we do so have completely shifted due to AI involvement in the transcription process.

AI: That's really interesting - you're experiencing AI's impact even though you're not directly using it yourself. It sounds like PowerScribe One has fundamentally changed what your role looks like.

Can you walk me through what a typical day used to look like before this change, versus what it looks like now?

User: Prior to the implementation of PowerScribe One, I was paid based on productivity, with a flat pay rate per line typed. Upon logging in, I would listen to dictations and type/edit what was stated, following strict formatting regulations. After a report was done, I would begin the next, with heavy emphasis on wasting as little time as possible. It was a fast paced role but could be incredibly stressful, as my pay was directly linked to my ability to focus and complete work rapidly and effectively, leading to me feeling the need to work extra hours or through my breaks at times to compensate if focus was challenging that day. I rarely took time off because I felt guilty doing so, with so many reports to type and my time off pay rate so much lower than I was capable of earning on the clock. 

Now, I am paid a base hourly rate, so time on the clock and off the clock is paid identically. I feel much less guilty taking time off, as our per diems can do the role with no substantial change in productivity. My day is primarily composed of phone calls to and from patients and providers, pushing images through PACS and other systems to ensure continuity of care is maintained for patients being seen at multiple facilities, and relaying priority report results to providers as requested. It is a much slower role, and while it can be quite busy at times it tends to be more sporadic and varied in what it requires of me.

AI: That's a profound transformation - it sounds like the AI implementation didn't just change your tasks, but completely restructured your relationship with work itself. The shift from piece-rate pay tied to typing speed to hourly pay for coordination work seems like it would change the entire stress dynamic.

When this transition was happening, how did you and your teammates react to learning that AI would be taking over the transcription part of your jobs?

User: Most of us were shocked. I am the youngest on my team, but the majority of the others are nearing retirement and have been in this role, typing every day, since before I was born. Due to annual raises accrued, I was the only one who saw a reduction in pay due to the shift to hourly wages--the others' hourly rates are far above what their productivity had allowed. There has been some expressed boredom due to the amount of downtime, but I have personally benefitted from that! I've gone back to school and am working on my MACP, completing reading tasks in between work tasks, which would not have been possible under the prior workflow.

AI: That's fascinating - so the impact wasn't uniform across your team. It sounds like for your more senior colleagues, this was almost like an unexpected windfall, while you experienced a pay cut but gained something valuable in flexibility and time.

Tell me more about how you've been able to use that downtime for your studies. What's that been like, being able to weave your education into your work hours?

User: It's been an adjustment, but a pleasant one. I benefit from regular intellectual stimulation throughout my day, and while the old workflow could fit that bill early in my time with the hospital, in more recent years that hadn't been the case. I wasn't learning new terminology on a day to day basis nearly as profoundly, so it had grown a bit stale in that regard. Now, I'm able to shift between intellectually stimulating and curiosity sparking tasks during work hours, which has truly been a gift. There are days when I'm not able to do much beyond my work tasks, as obviously I don't want to sacrifice my productivity or quality of work in those given that is what I am being paid to do, but there are also days when my executive functioning is more attuned to multitasking and I'm able to accomplish a great deal.

AI: That's such an interesting perspective on how AI has created space for intellectual growth in your day. It sounds like you're finding this change has actually re-energized your relationship with learning and mental stimulation.

I'm curious about your colleagues who mentioned feeling bored with the increased downtime. How are they adapting to this very different pace of work, especially given their long history with the more intense, productivity-driven system?

User: We all work from home, so I'm not sure what they're doing during their downtime. It's possible, as they are older and do not have young children in the home and are not in school, that they are caught up on housework and do not have hobbies that they feel comfortable doing during their downtime, so are effectively just hanging out for a large portion of the day. I can see how that would be boring! However, as a knitter and avid reader that has simply not been my experience, even during breaks between semesters.

AI: That makes sense - having personal interests that can fill those quiet moments would definitely make a difference in how you experience this new workflow.

Looking at this transition from a broader perspective, how do you think about the fact that AI essentially replaced the core skill you and your colleagues had developed over years or even decades? Is that something that feels significant to you, or does it feel more like a natural evolution?

User: I'm torn, to be honest. I've seen an uptick in errors within reports, and those do impact patient care. I think PowerScribe One has the potential to do a great job replacing the transcription team, but that it is a flawed product at the moment and would benefit from our ability to edit reports as needed. That said, if errors were so frequent that it was deemed necessary for us to provide some degree of overview and editing, I'm sure that would be requested. 

I see the criticism that AI is taking jobs, but I also recognize that the human mind has the ability to perform functions and offer services rooted in intellectual curiosity, collaboration, and creativity that ultimately would make most workers happier with their roles than menial tasks have. If we can get to a point as a society that AI is able to reliably produce accurate, high quality work on menial, administrative, mathematical/data-driven etc tasks, that would free humans up to do work that is personally resonant. Obviously this would ideally spark a restructure of the economic system to allow us to continue to make livings that allow us to pay for the goods and services being offered as well as our basic needs, but perhaps trade could come into play. I'm not an economist!

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to think about it - you're seeing both the immediate practical concerns about quality and the bigger picture potential for more meaningful work. The tension you describe about the errors is particularly interesting since you have the expertise to catch them but aren't currently asked to.

You mentioned that if the error rate was problematic enough, they'd probably ask your team to provide oversight. Do you think there's a chance your role might evolve to include some of that quality control, or does it feel like the transcription chapter is completely closed?

User: I think continued evolution is inevitable, but unlikely to return to the transcription realm. We are shifting to a new PACS system next month and I believe our role is in the process of transitioning toward a more integrated support function for the radiology department. Work is being offloaded from those whose roles are evolving differently, and the department as a whole is constantly changing. What's seemed critical to my supervisors is increasing communication between teams within the department to improve our ability to collaborate on complex tasks. There does seem to be a degree of fear regarding our being deemed unnecessary by hospital higher-ups, but the measures being taken to shift focus to the human element seem to be effective thus far.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like your department is proactively reshaping itself to emphasize the uniquely human contributions, particularly around communication and collaboration. The timing with the new PACS system seems strategic.

When you think about this experience of having AI change your work so dramatically, how has it affected how you feel about AI's role in your future career or in healthcare more broadly? Has it made you more optimistic, more cautious, or something else entirely?

User: I'm currently in school to become a licensed professional clinical counselor specializing in expressive arts therapies. I have seen AI be implemented by some future colleagues in scheduling or note-taking tasks, and my feelings are mixed. I'm leery of the function I've seen some utilize in which the session is recorded, with AI summarizing to generate notes which are then combed over by the clinician, followed by deletion of the recording. I think this has the potential to yield privacy concerns as well as challenges in producing accurate reports, additionally missing the human element of sensed nonverbal cues and notes based on more empathic/intuitive aspects of the therapeutic relationship. I do not personally feel I would use it in that way. However, I do feel AI could be an asset in scheduling, in Telehealth management and billing/coding tasks (of course with overview and editing by my eye), as well as in structuring/formatting my personally input reports. For example, if I created a complex system prompt for the handling of the information I type, I could focus on offloading my impressions as accurately and thoroughly as possible in the limited time allotted for note-taking and records-keeping between sessions, letting AI handle the preliminary formatting of my draft--again to be reviewed and edited by me after my day of sessions has ended.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - you're clearly thinking deeply about where AI can genuinely support your work versus where the human element is irreplaceable. The distinction you're making between using AI to handle the administrative scaffolding while preserving the clinical judgment and therapeutic relationship seems particularly thoughtful.

Looking back on this whole experience with PowerScribe One and thinking ahead to your future career, what would you say has been the most important lesson about working alongside AI systems? What insight would you want other professionals to have as they navigate similar changes?

User: A primary takeaway, particularly given the conversations I have had with patients in recent months versus the zero I had in my original role, is that empathic connection and voice--or better yet, face to face--communication with an individual who seems to truly care can make a dramatic impact in morale and sense of purpose in the workforce, regardless of whether the role is personally fulfilling. I am not passionate about my current role in the way I am and will continue to be about my future one, but I feel far less nihilistic when my actions directly bolster others' sense of safety, of being cared for and supported. It's edifying to know that what you do makes a difference both over time and in the moment. 

If AI takes over many of the tasks that do not require interpersonal connection, perhaps we can get back to our humanity in the time that affords.

AI: That's a beautiful insight - the idea that AI might actually help us rediscover and prioritize our humanity by taking over tasks that don't require that human connection. Your experience of moving from isolated transcription work to patient interaction seems to have given you a firsthand appreciation of what makes work meaningful beyond just productivity or pay.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI's impact on your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that feels important to share?

User: I am concerned about the use of generative AI in the workforce and the laziness I have witnessed in some when they take generated text and utilize it without first reviewing it for relevancy or contextual accuracy. I think that AI is often only as good as the user's ability to apply wisdom and discretion in its use. so I look forward to seeing AI integration with more oversight and uniformity in application. This is less an AI critique and more one for I/O psych teams, I suppose. We need to maintain our pride in what we do and the ethics of putting forth quality work regardless of the tools at our disposal. Perhaps AI driven workplace products could develop safeguards to reduce carelessness and autopilot on the part of the workers?

AI: That's such an important point - you're highlighting that the technology itself isn't the issue, but rather how people choose to engage with it. Your emphasis on maintaining professional pride and ethical standards regardless of the tools available really resonates with the thoughtful approach you've described throughout our conversation.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your nuanced view of how AI might help us return to more human-centered work, and your concern about maintaining quality and ethics in how these tools are implemented.

Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! It was a pleasure speaking with you. Best of luck with your studies in expressive arts therapy - it sounds like a perfect fit given your thoughtful approach to human connection and meaningful work.

Have a great rest of your day!
