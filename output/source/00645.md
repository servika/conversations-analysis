Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, let's get started

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostly use it for zhuzhing up emails or looking for mistakes in writing for important information

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned "zhuzhing up" emails and checking for mistakes in important writing. 

Tell me more about what that looks like in practice. When you're working on an email or an important document, how do you decide it needs that extra polish?

User: I have trouble with missing little words when typing. If it's something that has to go to our program directors or students. Or possibly a formal email on behalf of a higher up person

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those high-stakes communications where accuracy and tone really matter. 

When you're working on one of these important emails or documents, walk me through how you typically use AI to help. Do you write the full thing first and then ask AI to review it, or does your process look different?

User: I write the whole first and them ask AI to review. I don't really want AI writing too much for me and want to keep it in my own voice without weird AI quirks like emdashes

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - keeping your own voice while getting that extra layer of review. I'm curious about those "weird AI quirks" you mentioned, like emdashes. 

What other AI writing habits have you noticed that you actively try to avoid? How do you spot when something sounds too "AI-ish" versus your natural style?

User: Overly flattering, too many exclamation points. Weird phrasings or flowerly language. I also try to be more formal and avoid using "please" too much. I want my writing to come off more gender neutral than feminine

AI: That's a really insightful observation about tone and how it can come across in professional settings. You mentioned wanting your writing to be more gender neutral rather than feminine - it sounds like you're quite deliberate about how you present yourself professionally.

When you're reviewing AI suggestions, how do you typically adjust them to match that more neutral, formal tone you're going for?

User: I'll read it over and see if there is anything that raises a red flag for me. Sometimes AI writing just like raises my heckles and gives the ick

AI: That "ick" feeling is such a visceral reaction - it sounds like you've developed a real instinct for spotting when something doesn't feel right. 

Can you think of a specific example where you read an AI suggestion and immediately thought "nope, that's not me"? What was it about that particular phrasing or suggestion that set off those alarm bells?

User: I was writing an email on behalf of a program director (the big boss) and there was something that felt overly nice. Not that this person isn't nice but the email required a formal tone and the AI bot went way too far in the other direction. I read it and was like this is not the tone I want. Why are there so many pleases and exclaimations.

AI: That's such a perfect example - you had to represent someone else's voice and authority level, not just your own. It sounds like the AI completely missed the mark on the power dynamics and formality required.

When you caught that mismatch, what did you do next? Did you go back and rewrite it yourself, or did you try to give the AI more specific guidance about the tone you needed?

User: I'll rewrite it and then put it into AI with more specific guidelines

AI: So you've developed this iterative process - rewrite first, then give the AI clearer instructions to get what you actually need.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes, there are some. Things that are "easy" sends - quick emails or something like that

AI: Interesting - so for those quick, straightforward emails, you just handle them yourself rather than involving AI at all.

What is it about those "easy sends" that makes you think "I've got this" versus the more formal communications where you do want that AI review?

User: I just need a quick response. I don't need it to be in a formal tone or proofreading isn't a big thing for this communication

AI: That makes total sense - when the stakes are lower and it's just about getting a quick message across, the extra step isn't worth it.

When you are using AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you collaborate with it throughout the process rather than just handing off complete tasks - is that accurate?

User: Yes, I don't trust AI to do things fully without me reviewing or having written it first

AI: That trust element is really important - you want to maintain control over the process. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk openly about using it, or is it more something you've figured out on your own?

User: People talk about it. There are a couple of admins in my department who use it for something like summarizing a Zoom meeting or things like that. I think some people also use it in a similar way I do. Some people aren't super tech savvy, so I don't think they're interested

AI: So there's this mix in your workplace - some people are finding practical uses like meeting summaries, others are doing similar work to you, and then some just aren't engaging with it at all.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I felt frustrated once when I had created a page in HTML for Canvas LMS. I had wanted AI to make the same code but replace a couple of links for me. For whatever reason, it kept putting the links in the wrong places

AI: That sounds really annoying - you had something that was working perfectly, you just needed a simple swap, and the AI kept messing up the placement.

What did you end up doing in that situation? Did you eventually get it to work, or did you just go back and make those link changes yourself?

User: I just made the changes myself

AI: That makes complete sense - sometimes it's just faster to do it yourself than keep wrestling with the AI.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm definitely trying to get on more varied projects but I don't think AI could do my job fully. There would always need to be some human element to it

AI: That confidence in the human element of your work is interesting. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll expand how you use it, or do you see yourself sticking with this current approach of using it mainly for polishing and review?

User: I think I'll stick to my current approach. I worry about the environmental impacts of AI and honestly might further scale back

AI: That environmental concern is something I don't hear mentioned very often - it sounds like that's becoming a real factor in how you think about using these tools.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining your own voice and being so deliberate about tone, especially in those high-stakes communications.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
