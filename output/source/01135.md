Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I do visual arts in a variety of mediums. An example project may be an acrylic painting, that I may than scan to make prints out of.

AI: That's great - I love the combination of traditional and digital elements in your process. The transition from physical painting to digital prints is really interesting.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I like using AI to brainstorm and when I am stuck. I might use it to help generate a list of ideas when I have a creative block, or to help expand an idea. For instance, if I know I want to paint something using paynes grey with a red accent that has an autumn theme, I might ask AI for a list of possible subject matter or ideas for paintings.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to use AI as a creative partner for ideation. I can see how having that brainstorming support would be valuable when you hit those creative blocks.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: An example of when I used AI was when I wanted to paint a series of woodland themed small paintings. I planned to paint a mushroom in one, a fern in another, and then I asked AI for a list of other ideas to help me come up with other subjects to expand the series on theme. It helped me decide to also paint a fallen tree and wild berries.

AI: That's a wonderful example - it sounds like AI helped you expand and round out your woodland series in a really organic way. The mushroom, fern, fallen tree, and wild berries create such a cohesive collection.

When you're working with AI in situations like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am driving the creative decisions. I find I need to carefully craft the prompts and feed the AI creativity to get helpful feedback and responses.

AI: That's really insightful - the idea that you need to "feed the AI creativity" to get useful responses back. It sounds like there's a real skill to crafting those prompts effectively.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I'm not sure if anything has changed. Sometimes AI is able to help, othertimes it is not helpful. Now, when I feel blocked or frustrated, I have an additional tool (AI) to try to use to see if it unblocks my creative flow.

AI: That's a really practical perspective - having AI as one more tool in your toolkit when you need it, rather than it fundamentally changing how you work. It sounds like it's become part of your problem-solving arsenal.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm not a fan of people using AI to generate images or replace artists in fields. I worry humans will loose artistic talents or appreciation for human made art.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making - using AI as a brainstorming tool versus using it to generate the actual artwork. Your concern about losing human artistic talents and appreciation for handmade work really resonates.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I hope it will be more helpful and insightful, and able to help me grow as an artist. I would like it to be able to critique my work in a constructive way to help me grow was an artist by providing useful tips about how to practically improve my work.

AI: That's such an interesting vision - AI as a constructive critic and mentor to help you develop your artistic skills. The idea of getting practical, actionable feedback to improve your technique sounds really valuable.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you're the one driving the creative decisions and need to "feed the AI creativity" - that really captures something important about how this collaboration works.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that covers it all, thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a brainstorming partner while maintaining your role as the creative decision-maker, along with your thoughtful distinction between AI as a tool versus AI as a replacement for human creativity, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and your concerns. Have a wonderful rest of your day, and best of luck with your woodland series and future projects!
