Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, let's dive in

AI: Perfect! Let's start with the big picture.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure, generally I use AI to assist with writing tasks, such as editing emails, giving feedback on tone of writing, and ensuring content creation aligns with existing tone and style based on other communications from within my business. I also use AI as a research tool for giving oversight into technical aspects of my job

AI: That's helpful context. When you mention using AI for research on technical aspects of your job, what does that look like in practice? Can you walk me through a recent example of how you used AI for technical research?

User: Yeah, sure. So I run a yeast business that grows and sells yeast to craft breweries in New Zealand and Australia. Sometimes I will use AI to help me understand a specific niche fermentation or brewing process, or to ask questions and fact check my assumptions around different aspects of brewing and fermentation and yeast health, and or other related processes

AI: That's fascinating - using AI to support your expertise in such a specialized field. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your yeast business that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Hmm, I do like to use AI more as a general overview type of tool. I'm still not 100% convinced of AI's ability to produce factual information consistently, so I use it to bring up sources that I can fact check myself against its claims. I guess I prefer to have that final look myself, but use AI as a bit of a research assistant. I also don't use AI for any financial stuff, and I generally like to re-edit AI'

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a research assistant while maintaining that final verification step yourself. You mentioned you like to re-edit AI's work. Can you tell me more about that process? What are you typically adjusting when you edit AI-generated content?

User: Yeah sorry my message cut off there. I like to use AI again for ideation and suggestion when it comes to content creation, however I like to re-edit the suggestions I receive to ensure they align with my style and tone, and my preference for a localised Kiwi-business-casual style

AI: Got it - so you're using AI for that initial creative spark but then making it authentically yours with that Kiwi business-casual voice.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Yeah thats right. I generally will come to the LLM with either an initial query or request for a rewrite or extraction. In the case of a rewrite I'll take its suggestion, then re-edit that externally, however I'll go back and forth with requests for rephrasing or certain sentences that I'll then incorporate. With research I'll generally get it to answer initially, then come back and ask follow up questions like source verification, or comparisons or alternative explanations. In terms of extraction I'll follow up responses with requests for the model to show me where the information its extracted was in the source document. So I kind of use it as if it were an intern, where I'll get it to generate content or information that I'll collaborate on it with, with me making the final call on what the finished product it

AI: That's a great analogy - treating it like an intern where you're collaborating but maintaining final authority. It sounds like you've developed a pretty systematic approach.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you're running your own business, I'm curious if interactions with clients, suppliers, or others in the brewing industry have shaped your AI usage at all.

User: Hmmm. It's just me and one other here at my business, however I have another job at a brewery where AI is being incorporated more, so I kind of see the applicatios they're using it for and I guess it makes me feel more comfortable bringing it in at my own business. Honestly because the brewing industry in Nz is so small, I try to only use AI in that intern or creative spark capacity, especially for email comms, as its the human/personal touch that makes all the difference in this industry

AI: That's a really insightful point about the personal touch being crucial in your industry. It sounds like you're navigating that balance between efficiency and maintaining authentic relationships.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Ahh, I generally feel pretty satisfied with AI when I use it in the capacity I do, where I'm not expecting it to fulfill my desires completely, but support me with ideation etc. I recall I was pretty happy with some suggestions a LLM made in terms of re-writing/updating our website copy. It did really well in effectively tightening up the copy while retaining the tone and style of the original copy I had written. I remember being frustrated when trying to get an LLM to rewrite an email by my prompting it with tone suggestions, it just never quite got where I wanted it to

AI: That's a great contrast - the website copy working well versus the email tone never quite landing right. It sounds like the difference might have been in how much original material the AI had to work from.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is something I consider. I've always prided myself on my command of the English language and general communication skills, and this probably informs my refusal to relinquish the editorial oversight I retain.

AI: That's thoughtful - holding onto that editorial oversight as a way to maintain and exercise those communication skills you value.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you use it, or do you think you'll stick with this current approach of treating it like that research assistant and creative intern?

User: I guess it depends on how its capabilities evolve. I can see myself using it more for menial tasks like invoicing etc once it becomes reliable. But I don't think I'll ever give up the human element for communications

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that human element in communications while leveraging AI as a research assistant and creative collaborator - that balance seems really important in your industry.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nah, nothing further to add :)

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative tool while maintaining editorial control and that crucial human touch will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really interesting to hear how you've found that sweet spot between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving what makes your business authentically yours. Thanks again, and best of luck with your yeast business!

User: Cheers!

AI: Cheers! Have a great day!
