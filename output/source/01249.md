Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: lets begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I was recently conducting research on optimizing a bromination reaction on a specialized organic molecule that contains multiple reactive sites. The use of protecting groups was not feasible under the circumstance. So it calls for a design-of-experiment(DOE) to be conducted to find the optimal condition that favours the formation of desired product over other isomers, or maximize the yield of desired product while minimizes formation of isomers. a set of DOE experiments (64 experiments) was conducted and a lot of data were generated as well. I compiled the data into excel and feed it to AI so it can conduct some statistical analysis for me, and provide my with cleaned data so I can make graphs that showcase the relationship between each factor(temperature, substrate loading, equivalences, reaction time, yield of desired product, yield of isomers)

AI: That's a really interesting project - bromination selectivity can be quite challenging with multiple reactive sites. 

Tell me more about that step where you compiled the data into Excel and fed it to AI for statistical analysis. What specifically did you ask the AI to do with your DOE data?

User: So the raw data generated from the wet lab were compiled in excel sheets, with corresponding "properties" or parameters, you could say. Then a series of analysis were conducted, including ANOVA (analysis of variance) to narrow down parameters with significant influences, becuase we started with about 10 parameters, and it would be impractical to test each of them under full analysis. The top 4 parameters were chosen based on ANOVA results. We then started with 2 levels for each factor, and conducted a factorial design. The results obtained was used to construct a response surface plot that best showcased the direction of optimization. These analyses were done using AI.

AI: That's a sophisticated analytical approach - going from 10 parameters down to 4 using ANOVA, then building response surfaces. 

For that series of analyses you mentioned - the ANOVA, factorial design, and response surface plotting - how did you decide whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for handling this statistical work?

User: We are always trying to integrate AI into our work flow becuase it can save an enormous amount of time, especially when dealing with sophisticated numerical analyses. The work ideation were conversed extensively with AI prior to execution. During the workflow, we have consistently updating the AI by feeding it with our ideation adn observation from the experiements so it has a better understanding can help us decide which analytical tool to use

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI was deeply integrated throughout your entire process, from ideation all the way through analysis. You mentioned feeding the AI your observations from experiments to help it understand better.

Tell me more about that ongoing conversation with AI during the workflow. What kind of observations or updates were you sharing, and how did that shape the analytical recommendations it gave you?

User: Taking the bromination reaction as an example, we first gave it a few synthetic routes that we sought out based on our knowledge and existing literatures. We then asked the AI to compare and contrast them to help us narrow down to a few synthetic route that we can try. We also discuss these potential routes within our brainstorming sessions with scientists to verify their validity. Then after testing the routes that we finalized, it still had the issue where bromination would happen at a few sites, which finally led us to conduct DOE and use AI to help us optimize the route.

AI: That's a really comprehensive integration - AI helping with route comparison, then working alongside your team discussions, and finally assisting with the optimization when selectivity became the challenge.

We're about one-third of the way through our conversation now. 

Thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't used AI - whether that's the actual wet lab experimentation, literature review, or other aspects - what's kept you from trying AI in those areas?

User: Literature search is one key area that we did not use AI at all, because based on our experience, AI is not yet fully capable of such work, due to paywall restrictions, evaluation of literature for unreported molecules and sometimes provide hallucinated results.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the paywall issue and hallucination risks would be particularly problematic for literature work where accuracy is critical.

When you've used AI for the statistical analysis and route comparison work that you mentioned, how do you verify or validate what it produces? What's your process for making sure the ANOVA results or synthetic route recommendations are reliable?

User: For route comparison, we can ask the AI to find us the cost of each individual reagent, and gave us an estimate on the total cost per unit of product, this work is extremely time consuming when it comes to human doing it, becuase one needs to search all chemical supplies and punching the numbers to get a reasonable estimation on cost. AI saves a lot of time since we can provide it with a list of suppliers and their website and the AI does the rest of searching and cost estimation. Also, We do evaluate the ANOVA results AI provided using existing statistical software designed for these work, but due to the time-consuming nature of such process, we turned our attention to AI hoping that it will save significant amount of time.

AI: That cost estimation work sounds like a perfect fit for AI - all that supplier website searching and number crunching would indeed be incredibly time-consuming manually.

You mentioned that you do evaluate the ANOVA results using existing statistical software, but it's time-consuming so you're hoping AI can replace that step. How comfortable are you with relying primarily on AI's statistical analysis without that verification step, especially when it's informing which parameters to focus on for your experiments?

User: Without verification could be risky, as wrong result will not just be time consuming but will also make us question everything, from reaction condition to choice of reagent.

AI: Absolutely - when those statistical results are driving your experimental design decisions, getting them wrong would have cascading effects through the whole project.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would hope that AI can do literature search and also learn from existing literatures, but also come with a bit of innovation in terms of route design for novel molecule synthesis. FOr example, it would be nice to provide AI with a starting material and a targeet molecule, it would spew out the synthetic route of it.

AI: That would be incredibly powerful - essentially having AI that could both comprehensively search literature and then creatively design novel synthetic routes based on that knowledge. That sounds like it would transform the early stages of your research process.

We're nearing the end of our conversation now. Those are all my main questions, but your perspectives on how AI fits into complex experimental workflows - particularly that balance between time-saving benefits and the need for verification - were really insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no that was all

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can dramatically speed up tasks like cost estimation and statistical analysis, while also highlighting the real risks of relying on unverified results for critical experimental decisions, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into actual scientific work.

Your point about wanting AI that could do comprehensive literature searches and innovative route design for novel molecules was particularly interesting - that would clearly be a game-changer for the ideation phase of your research.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
