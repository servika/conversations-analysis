Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure thing. I am a technical integration engineer at a college. I provide level 2 tech support, design and build integrations, write technical documentation and provide project management. I use ChatGPT multiple times a day in all of these tasks. I will copy error messages I receive from customers to help me troubleshoot if I am unfamiliar and a quick google search yields unhelpful results. I have created GPTs for the applications I support (like Adobe and Perceptive Content) and use those to assist me with creating end-user documentation as well as operations documentation (change models and procedures) for internal runbooks. I use it as a planning partner to create work breakdowns for new projects. I use it to help brainstorm solutions and help me develop them into concise executive summaries. I use it to explain sections of inherited code so that I can revise or update it to accomplish new outcomes. I give it the role of senior developer and have it run code reviews on pull requests and teach me what I need to know to fix it. I use it to help me make emails and announcements more impactful and explain it's changes so I can become a better writer. I use it to review release notes against my current processes to tell me what I need to be aware of and provide fixes.

AI: Wow, you've really integrated AI across your entire workflow! That's fascinating how you've created specialized GPTs for different applications you support.

Tell me more about using AI as a "planning partner" for project work breakdowns. What does that interaction typically look like?

User: Typically I will share the clients project request details with AI. I will then provide in and out of scope items that I've worked with the client on and ask it to review those things and tell me what I may be missing for scope. Then I have it generate a work breakdown for Jira using the hierarchy of Epic-Story-Task for me to review. When I am stuck I will ask it to provide a few design solutions and potential phasing. I will also sometimes ask it to provide metric before- and-after categories I can collect to show to the client as proof that the project was successful.

AI: That's a really structured approach to project planning. It sounds like you're using AI to help you think through different angles you might not have considered.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle tasks that have specific data inputs and outputs. This is based on past experiences of writing detailed prompts and uploading data in very specific structure only to get it back where those instructions were not fully fulfilled or data was missing or changed. I find that it is faster to do it myself or ask AI to help with the PowerShell script to update the data rather than for AI to do it all.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you've learned where the boundaries are through experience. It sounds like when data integrity is critical, you'd rather maintain direct control.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I use AI mainly as a collaboration partner. I will ask it to tell me what I am missing, explain why something may or may not be a good idea, flesh out something I have already established a framework for, or grade my work/progress. I rarely assign it tasks due to trust issues. I currently only have one task assigned which is related to it checking Adobe API release notes against my current API configuration every Friday and sending me a report if it finds anything that I need to be aware of.

AI: That's really interesting - you've found one specific, bounded task where you're comfortable with full delegation, but otherwise you treat AI more as a thinking partner. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Our director has required us to do at least one learning task/exercise/webinar/etc related to AI every month. Our department is very supportive of using AI so long as we are not sharing proprietary or secure data and invites sharing of our experiences with others. I use AI more than most in my department for work. Others use it for personal tasks/research or entertainment.

AI: It sounds like you have a progressive workplace environment that's encouraging AI exploration. That monthly learning requirement is interesting - it shows real organizational commitment.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes - I have had many learning breakthroughs lately that have resulted in large value-add implementations because of my interactions with AI - mostly through vibe-coding. It is hard to take python or groovy classes that teach everything but without application it doesn't stick. I recently was able to use AI to help me write a groovy script to accomplish a task that was costing folks in my department many hours a week and had it teach me groovy along the way. On the flip side, vibe coding has also lead to some of my biggest frustration where the solutions AI offers are overly elaborate and I have to guide it back to something reasonable. This recently happened on a PowerShell script I needed help on where it told me the outcome was not possible so I went on my own for awhile and brought my idea and current state of work back to the AI where it acknowledged the pathway as viable and helped me finish it.

AI: That's a perfect example of the collaborative dynamic you described! "Vibe-coding" is such a great term for that exploratory approach where you're learning by doing with AI as a guide.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think that there are certain things that won't be required and I am ok with that. Just like I drive a car but have no idea how it works. I see AI as an catalyst to what humans, including me, are capable of. I would never have been able to create the groovy script saving my coworkers 10-14 hours every week without it. Which then means those co-workers also would not have 10-14 hours of their time back to do things that are in their backlog. Workers, including myself still are required to provide the inputs and prioritization layers on top of the outputs AI provides. AI is not completely autonomous so I am still required to decide when to use AI, what to provide it, how to direct its output, and permission to implement.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing AI as expanding your capabilities rather than replacing them. The car analogy is spot-on.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Hopefully continued experiences will allow a more trustful relationship where I can "bring it with me" to provide in the moment feedback rather than me having to gather, summarize, compose, and direct AI. All of that takes time. Time saved later when AI assists with generation but in the beginning sometimes all of that prevents me from engaging with AI.

AI: That vision of AI as a more seamless, "in the moment" partner is really compelling - where the overhead of preparing and directing it becomes minimal.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a catalyst that expands human capabilities rather than replacing them, and how you've found that sweet spot of collaboration versus delegation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Only that I often struggle with competing AIs. Zoom has an AI. Microsoft has an AI. Atlassian has an AI. And then there are standalone AIs. It sometimes is time consuming to find the right one for the job and remember how to interact with each for the best outcome. It's kind of like I am a manager and I have a team of reports-to that are all the AIs. I have to learn the personalities, strengths, and weaknesses of each so I know who to go to and how to work with them to get the best outcome.

AI: That's such a valuable insight - the cognitive load of managing multiple AI "personalities" and remembering their different strengths and interaction patterns. It really does sound like managing a diverse team where you need to know who's best suited for what and how to communicate effectively with each one.

That adds a whole new dimension to AI adoption in the workplace that we hadn't touched on - it's not just about learning to work with AI, but learning to orchestrate multiple AI tools effectively.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about collaborative AI use, the evolution from experimentation to trusted delegation, and especially this challenge of managing multiple AI tools will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: You're welcome!

AI: Thank you so much! This has been really insightful. Have a great rest of your day!
