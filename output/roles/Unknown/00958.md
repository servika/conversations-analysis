Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good, no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: i use AI fairly regularly throughout the day. I am a cybersecurity analyst and I mostly use it to assist me with researching various things during the course of investigating alerts and things like that

AI: That's really interesting. When you say researching various things during investigations, could you walk me through what that looks like? What specific types of research are you turning to AI for help with?

User: i find using AI is a much faster method for looking up things like "what does this command line execution actually do?", or "what software is this executable related to?". I use it to answer questions like that where i would normally need to go to google and search around for an answer. sometimes i will give it a script or something that I've copied and ask ai what the script does if I need some clarification or am not sure

AI: That sounds like AI is really streamlining your research process. When you're analyzing these scripts or command line executions, do you find yourself cross-checking the AI's explanations with other sources, or do you generally trust what it tells you about what the code does?

User: yes I absolutely do some sanity checking along the way if I feel the answer may not be correct. sometimes I already have an idea and the answer provided by the AI matches my preconceived idea so I trust it in those cases moreso. Other times I can tell by the answer it gives or through my own eperience that I need to take ai's answer with a grain of salt and verify through other means

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach to verification. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your cybersecurity work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: i don't really use AI to draft communications for me or anything like that. I try to refrain from having it give me pre-written explanations that I then would pass on. I may use some of it's language in my own explanation but I like to draft those things myself. I would say I also drive most of the actual analysis workflow but I do use ai to help guide me when I don't know which direction to go in the investigation sometimes

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping your own voice in communications and maintaining control of the analysis workflow. When you mention using AI to help guide you when you don't know which direction to go, can you tell me more about what that looks like? How does that conversation with AI typically unfold?

User: If i have reached a dead end in my investigation in terms of tracking down the origins or root cause of a particular process or other artifact, I will ask AI to give me alternate ideas on how to find what it is i'm looking for, or if I think I am running into vendor specific errors like syntax or how a tool logs certain events I will ask ai for guidance on those specific issues

AI: That's a really practical use case - having AI as a brainstorming partner when you hit those investigative roadblocks. When you're working with AI in these situations, would you say you're more collaborating with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a specific problem and let it work on that independently before you take the results and continue?

User: it is absolutely collaborative and almost like a conversation back and forth while i'm working the investigation. I am not sure how I would leverage AI on a task where it could work independently just because of the sensitivity and access issues with what I am working on. I had to redact and obfuscate a lot of information when speaking with ai to avoid spilling any sensitive or identifying information

AI: That collaborative, conversational approach makes a lot of sense, especially given those security constraints you're working within. I'm curious about how your workplace culture or your colleagues have influenced the way you use AI in your work. Have there been any discussions about AI use in your cybersecurity team, or have you noticed how others approach it?

User: i remember during orientation when i started this job they emphasized that they were very "pro ai" and wanted us to use it to help improve efficiency. but they also did warn us about being careful about the information you submit to avoid spilling data. as far as my coworkers go, it's not really discussed that much that i've seen. we are all IT people so I think we all use it to some degree but there is also i think an unacknowledged pressure to be 'smart' and so we don't really admit when we find answers through ai

AI: That's a fascinating dynamic - being encouraged to use AI for efficiency but also having that unspoken pressure around appearing knowledgeable. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: normally I am very satisfied with the speed at which i can judge something to be benign or suspicious by using ai as a research assistant. however i have been frustrated on a few occasions. recently i asked it about why vmtoolsd.exe would ever do a read operation on lsass. it told me there was never a reason for that. I wasn't sure about that answer but I searched the internet far and wide myself for an explanation and didn't find one. However i came to later find out through further investigation that it is kind of an expected behavior during vm backups/snapshots or at least that could plausibly explain it. following that I asked ai why it gave me the first answer and after confronting it later gave me the second answer. it basically said the backups/snapshot was a fringe use case and so it didn't offer it as an initial explanation which was annoying

AI: That's really telling about the limitations of AI when it comes to those edge cases or less common scenarios in cybersecurity. It sounds like AI was being overly definitive when uncertainty might have been more helpful. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: i think as ai improves it may become an issue in my field. I'm sure some C-suite executives already think ai can take over but based on what i see where ai is already integrated into some of our security tool platforms - it is not intelligent enough yet to replace a human analyst who has experience in the organization and can recognize things that are on the face of it maybe suspicious looking but under the surface are known to be legitimate admin activity. I think it is always important in any field for humans to maintain and increase their skills. I think the last thing we want to do as a species is relegate our intelligence, skills, and experience to a technology that may not always exist or be able to be leveraged

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the balance between leveraging AI and maintaining human expertise. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology improves or as you become more experienced with it?

User: i see it mostly staying the same in the short to mid term. long term there is no telling as advancements occur at a rapid pace. i would like to leverage it to help me automate more tasks in the future by having it streamline the programming process for me

AI: That's interesting - moving toward using AI to help with automation and programming. Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that balance between leveraging AI for efficiency while maintaining your own analytical skills and judgment, especially in such a specialized field like cybersecurity.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: i think that is about it

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research assistant in cybersecurity investigations, navigating those workplace dynamics around AI use, and thinking critically about verification and skill maintenance will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
