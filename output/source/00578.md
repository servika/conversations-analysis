Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm working with Anthropic's research team today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good. no questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work on healthcare databases and data applications to help our data scientists interface with healthcare data for research and development purposes. 

I always have ChatGPT accessible in my browser, which is now my go-to source for any questions and guidance on whatever I am working on. I use ChatGPT for general information (not necessarily asking for code) and for short standalone coding questions, like quick debugging or generating a mostly boilerplate chunk of code that I'm confident it will succeed at. This has 100% replaced how I previously used web searches and sites like StackOverflow.

I also use Cursor, but only for certain types of tasks that I know it will be good at. For example, I work on a data visualization app, where having the full codebase as context in Cursor gives it a high chance of success, and where the risk of critical errors is low. In other codebases where errors can be much more critical, I prompt Cursor in a way to keep it's edits very guided, so that it is helping me do work much faster, but I am never losing the thread of the changes it is making.

AI: That's really helpful context about your role and how you've integrated different AI tools. I'm curious about the distinction you made between using ChatGPT for quick questions versus Cursor for more complex tasks.

When you're deciding whether to handle something yourself or turn to AI, what goes through your mind? Are there certain types of coding tasks you prefer to tackle yourself, even when AI could potentially help?

User: I don't necessarily use Cursor for more complex tasks. My decision to use Cursor is always about the context window. Do I think having the entire codebase in context will be helpful? If not, i'll just copy and paste a snippet into ChatGPT. Especially with large codebases I am not familiar with, I love having Cursor and its access to tools to help me find bits of functionality and understand how the codebase works.

I do often just open up vanilla VSCode without any AI assistance, maybe ~50% of the time. I do this when I'm working on project where I know the entire codebase, I have a very well charted path forward, and basically know exactly what code I'm about to write. In these cases, I want the code written in a very specific way, so AI tools will just slow me down.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're being very strategic about when the AI adds value versus when it might actually slow you down.

Tell me more about those situations where you know exactly what code you're about to write. What makes those moments feel different from when you do reach for AI assistance?

User: These are the main criteria:
1. When I know the entire codebase very well (because I've written most of it, for example)
2. I have a very specific change / feature in mind
3. I have no ambiguity in mind head about how I'm going to implement it

In these cases, I won't have much for questions about errors / bugs, I don't really need to probe the AI for information, and even if it wrote the code correctly and quickly, I would likely be spending time editing / refactoring to make sure it is done exactly how I like it.

AI: That's a really clear framework you've developed. It sounds like you have a strong sense of when you want full control over the implementation details.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing conversation with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it something specific to handle and then take the output and move on?

User: If the previous conversation is useful to have in context, I keep it. If not, I wipe it and start fresh. I also often wipe the conversation and ask in a slightly different way just to see if i've tunneled the model down a specific path. I do this on ChatGPT, which I always use the "memory" feature turned off.

AI: That's interesting - you're very intentional about managing the conversation context and avoiding getting locked into one approach. 

I'm curious about the workplace side of things. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it openly, or is it more of an individual choice?

User: It is very much an individual choice, we don't have any policies or expectations about how to use it. I think my coworkers are learning, but most of them don't use it nearly as much as I do. At the moment, there is definitely a skill to be developed to use it well. It has greatly increased my productivity, and I hope it will do the same for more of my coworkers.

I think some may have had too much trust / too high of expectations in their limited experiences with it, and haven't quite found the way to integrate it well into their existing workflows yet.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the skill development aspect and how expectations can affect adoption.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The most satisfying tasks are when I have a very easily verifiable task I want completed, and Cursor just one-shots it perfectly in a single attempt. Recently I was cleaning up an app that is used to manage an inventory database. I asked cursor to add a button to the app in a specific location in the UI, along with a new backend api that makes specific updates to the database. I prompted it once, and when it was done, I could immediately see that it completed the task correctly just by clicking through my dev instance of the app. It was also done in a visually appealing way, with nice clean code that matched the rest of the codebase. It was simple, but it would've taken me an hour or more, and it did it in a minute.

AI: That sounds incredibly satisfying - having it execute exactly what you envisioned and integrate seamlessly with your existing code. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it feel like a natural balance given how you're using it?

User: Remember, you're supposed to ask, *how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?*

AI: I appreciate you keeping me on track! Let me ask the question I had planned:

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I plan to continue trying to integrate the cutting-edge of AI tools into my day-to-day. I think I will become more and more "dependent" on them in a good way. In the same way I am dependent on libraries when I write code. Getting good at using AI tools allows you to operate more productively, and focus on higher level decision making, instead of spending lots of time in the weeds on every task. When used correctly, this should allow myself and humans in general to become more and more creative over time.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to frame it - the dependency as empowering rather than limiting, similar to how we depend on libraries and other tools.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your strategic approach to AI integration and how you've developed skills around when and how to use different tools effectively. I particularly appreciated your framework for deciding when to work without AI assistance - those three criteria about knowing the codebase, having a specific change in mind, and having no implementation ambiguity.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope. Thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the strategic thinking behind AI tool selection, the importance of developing skills to use these tools effectively, and your perspective on AI as an empowering dependency will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
