Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, you can proceed with the questions.

AI: Great, thank you! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Sure! I'm a writer and my preferred genre is literary fiction. I write novels, novellas, short stories, and poetry. I'm a hybrid sort of writer, I plan things ahead, visualise scenes in my head before putting them to paper. It helps be get the work done faster and boots my confidence. I always want to have the emotional beats down and then I always leave room for updates as I go. So it's mixture of planning and discovery writing.

AI: That's a fascinating approach - having that blend of planning and discovery. The visualization aspect sounds particularly interesting.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Mainly during the brainstorming stage. My pride as a writer and my personal ethics don't allow me to use AI to create content instead of my own brain and imagination, but I do use it as a feedback tool and a beta reader. For instance, I test the sound of character names, I ask for information on etymology, what would a good name that means XYZ would be, how can I use a substitute for a name that exists in real life, e.g., a country by alluding to its cultural specifics. Basically, it acts as a search engine/feedback tool.

AI: That's really thoughtful - using AI as more of a research assistant and sounding board rather than for content generation. You mentioned testing character names and getting feedback like a beta reader.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was working on an entirely new project, which occured to me, making my own manga plot. I had. a long chat with an AI assistant trying out various character names, which I wanted to connect to particular character concepts, e.g., alluding to darkness, vengenance, light, hope, etc. I repeatedly asked it to summarise the plot thus far as it was evolving, which made it easier to keep track of my thoughts.

AI: That sounds like a really creative way to use AI as a thinking partner - helping you track your evolving ideas and test out how the names resonated with your character concepts.

When you're working with AI in those sessions, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: It's always me. I'm always mindful of being in control and the who ultimately makes the decisions as an author. I weigh every suggestion the AI makes, sometimes complement it with additional research via a search engine and reflect on it a lot. If it sounds intuitively right for the character, I take the suggestion. AI is a great organising tool, it helps fill gaps one might not immediately think of, though it's more technical than truly imaginative in a way a human brain would be.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - AI being more technical versus truly imaginative in the human sense. It sounds like you've found a clear balance where you maintain creative ownership while leveraging AI's organizational strengths.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I'm trying to use AI's presumed impartiality as an inhuman tool to assess any potential weaknesses in my writing, hoping it would be objective enough. It's useful as food for thought as a creator's brain and the inherent bias related to an idea you love might make you feel too close to your own creation, and thus blind to what might seem obvious to readers. So, it can act as a helpful impartial gap identifier and an organised assistant. I guess it's helped me distance myself from my emotional bond to the work as it encourages additional reflection, to look at it from the point of view of a reader and think more about what market niche it might fill.  AI can help an author think more about the business side of writing, what to prepare for and how it can impact your view on writing in general.

AI: That's really valuable - using AI's detachment to help you step back from that emotional closeness to your work and see it more objectively. The market perspective aspect is particularly interesting.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I think it can be really useful as an organsational tool, the kind of personal assistant a writer may need. But I'm personally very much against it being used as a creative subsitute to do what a writer is supposed to do, tell a story and do the actual writing work. The uniqueness of human creativity, flawed and unpredictable as it is, must stay intact.

AI: That's a powerful perspective - preserving what makes human creativity unique and irreplaceable while still finding value in AI as a support tool.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think it can simplify the aspects of the work that may seem tedious or boring, and take away the creative spark. Stuff like organising outlines, grammar editing, research. Of course, one should always back up AI research with additional insights, including from experts in fields, but it still saves time and effort. It can be a beneficial helper, which promotes critical thinking and gives an author a more holistic view of what it means to be an author in this day and age. It makes one more aware of everything external outside of pure creaitivty and passion.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI's "presumed impartiality" to help you see potential blind spots in your work, and how that's helped you think more holistically about both the creative and business sides of being an author.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I've covered all insights I wanted to share.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative ownership while leveraging AI as an organizational tool and impartial feedback source will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. 

I really appreciated how clearly you articulated that balance between embracing AI's practical benefits while preserving what makes human creativity irreplaceable. That perspective is invaluable as we work to understand how AI can best support rather than replace creative professionals.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your manga project and all your future writing!
