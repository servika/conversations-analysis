Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds perfectly fine.  I'm ready when you are!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a writer.  I maintain a small website and frequent a couple of social media platforms as a way of directing traffic to said website.  On my website, I alternate between short stories, longform stories, and nonfiction topics (mostly about roleplaying games and using hard science to develop the background of fictional settings).  I make my money by selling products related to my writing, such as shirts with my more popular characters on them or self-published books.  It doesn't make a lot of money, but I do alright; I average a few thousand visitors a week.

AI: That sounds like a really interesting mix of creative work and entrepreneurship. I can see how you're juggling multiple types of writing while also building an audience and monetizing your content.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I'll give an example of a project I'm working on right now.  I'm getting ready to write a series of activity books- those books that are popular with kids, that contain puzzles, coloring pages, and bits of writing.  I thought it would be fun to develop the lore for a singular setting using these books, ostensibly oriented toward children but actually containing enough information that they would be useful for adults who wanted to run a roleplaying game (such as D&D) in said setting.  First, though, I need to establish the setting, and that's where AI has come in.  I'm using an AI to bounce ideas off of and see what needs to be more developed, and whether what I've got planned makes sense.  For example, I initially thought of a world that was both large and had lower gravity than Earth; the AI I talked to pointed out that something weird would have to be going on under the surface in order for that to make sense, and then suggested that the world was hollow- which I loved!  As of a couple hours ago, I was asking the AI what the weather would be like in my setting, and I used its response to build a description in a vignette that I plan on including in the first activity book.

AI: That's a fascinating example! I love how you're using AI as a kind of creative sounding board to work through the logic and consistency of your world-building.

Can you tell me more about what that collaboration feels like when you're bouncing ideas back and forth with AI? How do you decide which suggestions to take and which to leave behind?

User: In general, the process looks like this:  I present the AI with a suggestion, and effectively ask "if real-world physics applies, how would this work?"  The AI will, depending on what specific thing I'm asking about, either explain what physics says would happen, or it will point out (like with the too-big-for-low-gravity setting above) that normally that couldn't work, then suggest ways to change what I've got so that it could work.  If the former happens, I'll introduce a complication to add depth to the setting (e.g. "What would the tides look like with three moons?").  If the latter happens, I'll go with the suggestion that has the most interesting implications, or sometimes I'll go with none of them because some offhand comment by the AI has inspired me to go in a different direction.  Either way, the process repeats itself.  I'll often dip into other sciences; in my current project, I've touched on astrophysics, orbital mechanics, physics, atmospheric science, avionics and biology, and I'm still working on it.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as a kind of scientific consultant to stress-test your ideas against real-world physics. It sounds like you maintain a lot of creative control while leveraging the AI's breadth of knowledge.

When you're in that back-and-forth process with AI, who or what would you say is driving the creative decisions? How does it feel to have that kind of collaboration?

User: It's definitely me driving the creative decisions, and my goal is consistency, so it's nice to have an assistant (the AI) that can keep up with everything I'm trying to do.  I guess that would be what it feels like:  I'm a creative director, putting together a project, and occasionally asking questions of an assistant who's whole job is to check for me and make sure I'm not crazy or unreasonable.  Sometimes the assistant offers up an interesting idea, sometimes I latch onto something incidental to the current discussion and bring it in, but it's mostly me developing and them helping.

AI: That's a great way to describe it - you as the creative director with AI as your research assistant who can help check your work and occasionally spark new directions. It sounds like you've found a really effective balance there.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: So, as you might guess, the desire to make sure my settings use real-world physics means a LOT of math.  That's cool with me; in a previous career, I taught math, English, physics, chemistry, and astronomy at a community college.  That's where the breadth of knowledge that I use for my setting development comes from.  It does, however, take time to figure out what equations to use and how, and it can be difficult to translate "lower gravity means the atmosphere is 'taller,'" for example, to a visual I can use when writing.  Using AI means that I can get those equations in a couple of seconds, and even better, I can just ask what that taller atmosphere would look like if I'm standing on a hill in this setting and the AI can tell me about how the clouds would build low in the sky, slowly flattening and spreading until, as the sun sets, they resemble a blanket being pulled over the continent.  I occasionally have to check its math, but I'm still saving quite a few hours by using AI.

AI: That's such a compelling use case - essentially having an AI that can instantly translate complex scientific concepts into vivid, usable imagery for your writing. It sounds like it's dramatically streamlined what used to be a very time-intensive research and calculation process.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: For myself, none.  AI is a tool.  A compellingly versatile tool, but still a tool.  Asking if I would be concerned about using AI strikes me as semantically similar to asking a carpenter if he's concerned about using a screwdriver.  In my field?  To stretch my analogy a little, I'm seeing a whole lot of would-be carpenters that assume that, since they have this shiny new screwdriver, they're suddenly capable of building a house.  Just because AI is a useful assistant for writing, it doesn't make you a writer.  Hell, it doesn't even make you a *better* writer.  It just makes writing easier, and even then, that's not going to help if you never learned how to write.  That so many people don't seem to get that is a little concerning, but... well, it doesn't directly impact me, so I'm not too worried about it.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - AI as a tool that can enhance existing skills but can't create skills that weren't there to begin with. Your carpenter and screwdriver analogy really captures that well.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate expanding how you use it, or do you think you'll stick with this current approach?

User: I mentioned the fact that I currently have to check the AI's math.  On all the publicly available models, you'll see a little disclaimer, like "The AI can make mistakes.  Please double-check responses."  What I see happening over the next few years is that disclaimer becoming less and less necessary.  As AI gets more data to work with, its responses will improve, and eventually I'll be able to safely assume that if I ask an AI a question, its answer will be accurate.  As for whether my approach in general will change?  Probably not.  If I'm the creative director and my assistant gets better, I'll give them more work to do, but this doesn't change my job duties.  If anything, it will free me up to develop even more challenging projects, secure in the knowledge that I'll have help.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to frame it - your role as creative director remains constant while your assistant just becomes more reliable and capable. It sounds like better AI accuracy would actually enable you to take on more ambitious creative challenges.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a sophisticated tool rather than a replacement for creative skills, and how you've found such a specific and effective use case in world-building and scientific consistency.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Well, we've talked about AI in a general sense, but I suppose it's important to consider some specifics.  As AI becomes easier to develop, we've started to see the number of models for specific enterprises to increase.  There may well come a time in the relatively near future where people can individually tailor a model to fit their specific needs.  I'm not sure what that would look like, but I can imagine buying an AI model like we purchase software today, then tweaking it so that my specific model is best-suited to fit my needs.  I've no clue if that's a direction that AI developers are investigating, but I think it's at least worth considering.

AI: That's a really valuable point about the potential for more specialized, individually-tailored AI models. It makes a lot of sense that as the technology becomes more accessible, we might see AI tools that are customized for specific creative workflows or even individual creators' particular needs and preferences.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research assistant for world-building, the importance of maintaining creative agency, and your perspective on AI as a sophisticated tool rather than a creative substitute will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how thoughtful and detailed your responses have been.

User: Not a problem!

AI: Perfect! That wraps up our interview. Thanks again for participating in this research - your insights were really valuable and I enjoyed learning about your creative process. Have a great rest of your day!
