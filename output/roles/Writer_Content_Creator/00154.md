Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm part of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I don't have any questions - thank you for asking!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't have a coding background so I use it when I need help with code for my job. Typiclaly T-SQL or Javascript but I also use it for CSS/HTML as needed. We have AI in the database we use at my job so it's pretty easy to access and use.

AI: That's really interesting that you have AI integrated directly into your database system at work. 

Can you walk me through what happens when you need help with code? How do you typically approach those situations?

User: I usually try to state the end goal I need to accomplish and where i'm at in the process first.

AI: Tell me more about that. What does it look like when you describe where you're at in the process to the AI?

User: Before we had AI integrated in the database, i'd have to see if it knew anything aboout Technolutions Slate to start. Then, from there describe where I was at. Typically it's a sub-query filter or export that has a formula to do something. For example, I needed help ranking a series of IDs so I asked the AI what formula i'd need to accomplish that.

AI: That ranking example sounds like a concrete problem you needed to solve. When you asked the AI for help with that formula, what happened next? Did it give you exactly what you needed, or was there more back-and-forth?

User: There was back-and-forth because it didn't know the system as well so there's usually error messages that needed to be resolved. Even with the AI built into our system - there's still the same back-and-forth as it's still learning.

AI: So you're working through those error messages together with the AI to get to a solution that actually works in your system. 

When you're in that back-and-forth process, how does that feel compared to other ways you might have solved coding problems before having AI available?

User: It's made it much faster. For example I had a project that involved exporting letters out of our system and running a macro to clean it up (font, font size, margin, insert a signature from a file, add a date to the header) so it could be printed. I don't have a background so I took a file that was partially working and searched the internet for code that would work. It took me three days to gete it figured out. I then tried the same thing with an AI and it was done in seconds.

AI: That's a dramatic difference - three days versus seconds. 

When you think about that experience, was there anything you lost or missed by having the AI solve it so quickly compared to those three days of searching and figuring it out yourself?

User: The part that was missed was my learning more about the syntax of a macro to see if the code would even work from forum posts or websites that fit my search parameters.

AI: That's a really thoughtful observation about the learning trade-off. 

Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: It's the things it can't do right now. I can't have it clean up code (usually HTML)  so I need to do that manually. I'm trying to use AI for more things that I'm not good at - next on my list is using it to help craft language for emails as while i'm an ok writer, it's not something that comes naturally.

AI: So you're actively looking to expand into areas where you feel less confident, like email writing. 

When you do use AI for work tasks, do you find yourself working alongside it throughout the entire process, or do you tend to give it a complete task and let it handle things independently?

User: I tend to work along side it for now. With my job I can't see much that I could just let it do without some back-and-forth as it learns. For example, to learn how we speak as an organization in our written communications--or for the target audience we are communicating to.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like there's a lot of institutional knowledge and context that the AI needs to learn about your organization and audience.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I think our organization is hesitant to embrace AI - I work for a University (I help with the CRM we use for enrollment management) so it's trying to figure out where AI fits in so we don't lose the human element of what we do.

AI: That tension between efficiency and maintaining the human element is really interesting, especially in higher education.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustrating would be needing to go back-and-forth to resolve an issue. As we use the AI integrated in our CRM more it's getting better at helping us out. It's satisfying to have it help solve an issue as that usually means we can automate something and make things work better (like rules in our system).

AI: The satisfaction from automation and making things work better really comes through. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think there will always need to be some type of review of how AI is used. I can see it helping with passive families coming to our website to learn more about our University and majors/programs as they apply to colleges.  What we are trying to figure out is where do our recruiters step in to help vs what can be done with AI.

AI: That balance between AI capabilities and when human recruiters should step in sounds like a key challenge your organization is working through.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can see us using it more. Our CRM just launched more AI features in June (2025) so this is still pretty new. Like having the ability to build an AI that we provide the system prompts and data to - that's brand new. Being able to open a side bar to ask questions or have it make edits to HTML or code as I'm working on an email or a portal is still brand new. As we need to do more with less I can see AI helping to support processes. I think the fear is if AI will make anyone lose their job. As I work with AI more I can see it being similar to when steno pools were used and how that changed with the personal computer. I think it will help create more jobs (maybe even better ones) in the long run.

AI: That historical perspective on technological change is really insightful - the comparison to how personal computers transformed work rather than just eliminating jobs.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the learning trade-offs and how your organization is navigating the balance between efficiency and maintaining that human element in higher education.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so - thank you!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working with AI in a university enrollment management context - from the technical problem-solving to the organizational considerations about maintaining human connection - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional settings.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the challenges. Have a great rest of your day!
