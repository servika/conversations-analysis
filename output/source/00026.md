Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope - let's go

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am an artist. I draw and sell products with my designs printed on them. I make money as an artist by selling my designs, primarily on Etsy. I also have released two coloring books, one of which was just professionally published and is available at Target & Barnes + Noble!

AI: That's fantastic - congratulations on getting your coloring book into Target and Barnes & Noble! That's a huge accomplishment.

It sounds like you have a really interesting mix going on - from individual designs for products to published coloring books. Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI to facilitate my business. I use AI for SEO and writing listing descriptions.

AI: Tell me more about that. How does using AI for the SEO and listing descriptions work in practice for you?

User: I will use an AI service or just a chat model to help me come up with tags for my Etsy listings. Etsy has specific parameters for tagging listings, so I use AI to try to come up with product tags that will promote my listings

AI:

User: I'll also provide brief descriptions of my products to have AI generate product listing descriptions with keywords. They're usually not very good, but they give me a good starting point. Or I can pick out some good phrases from the response.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI more for the business side of your art rather than the creative process itself. You mentioned the AI-generated descriptions usually aren't very good but give you a starting point. What makes them not quite right, and how do you typically refine them to work better for your listings?

User: They usually sound very formulaic, like you can tell they were written by a robot. They don't have much personality, and I feel like my art has personality. The responses sound sterilized.  I usually will copy & paste the whole response and edit it to sound more personable. I keep the keywords that help with SEO or performance, but I edit out the filler stuff that sounds cookie cutter. 

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's a real disconnect between the personality you put into your art and that formulaic AI tone. 

I'm curious about the actual art creation side of things. When you're drawing or developing your designs - the creative work itself - do you use AI at all in that process, or do you keep that completely separate from the business tools?

User: I don't use AI to create art. I've spoken with a chatbot before to braintorm concepts, but I have really mixed feelings about letting AI generate art itself.

AI: Tell me more about those mixed feelings you have about AI generating art itself.

User: It feels like I'd be letting down my community by using AI in my art process. I think there are probably certain areas where AI can be used meaningfully in art, but right now, it feels like AI art only hurts artists. Viewers are now skeptical that anybody's art could be AI-generated, and I think AI art lends itself to plagiarism and the unfair treatment of artists who don't want anything to do with AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective. It sounds like you see a real tension between AI as a potential creative tool versus its current impact on the artistic community and how people perceive art in general.

You mentioned you have used chatbots to brainstorm concepts though. Can you describe what that experience was like for you? How did that feel different from using AI to actually generate visual art?

User: I feed the AI a concept, and it helps me spitball similar ideas, but I still have to make the art. There's no visual or graphic creation, just discussion.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction - using AI for ideation and discussion versus visual creation. When you're in those brainstorming conversations with AI, how would you describe that collaboration? Are you driving the creative direction, or does it feel more like a back-and-forth exchange of ideas?

User: Well, I've only tried it probably twice. I didn't feel like it was very helpful because it wasn't very back-and-forth. I felt like it was only giving me surface-level ideas, nothing that really expanded the idea or came up with something new. However, I did recently use it for a similar purpose, although for personal reasons, not professional. I was asking it to come up with design ideas for my Minecraft house, and it definitely felt more collaborative and insightful. That conversation happened last week, whereas the business ones were probably from a year or two ago. Maybe things have improved since then.

AI: That's really fascinating - the difference between those experiences separated by a year or two, and also between the professional art context versus the personal Minecraft project. What do you think made the Minecraft conversation feel more collaborative and insightful compared to those earlier brainstorming sessions for your art business?

User: Well, it actually was coming up with new ideas. I gave it the initial concept, then it storyboarded some ideas, with concepts I hadn't previously considered. Then I asked it to tweak some things, and the process continued back and forth. Before, when I was asking it for art ideas, I felt like its suggestions were very surface-level. Nothing novel or creative.

AI: That's a really insightful comparison. It sounds like the quality of AI collaboration can vary significantly depending on the context and maybe how the technology has evolved.

Looking ahead, given these different experiences you've had - both the useful business applications and the mixed results with creative brainstorming - how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Well hopefully the art community will have a more concrete opinion on AI and its role in the field by then. Right now, it feels controversial and harmful. I think the business applications will only continue to improve. As for the creative side, I can see myself using AI in editing aspects, but I don't think AI should ever replace the human element of creating something.

AI: Those are some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the community context really shapes how you think about using these tools, and that distinction you drew between AI as a business utility versus its role in the actual creative process.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI as both a business tool and potential creative collaborator - while being mindful of your artistic community - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. 

It's been really valuable hearing how you've found practical uses for AI in the business side while maintaining clear boundaries around the creative process itself. Best of luck with your art and congratulations again on that coloring book success!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Thanks again for participating - this was really insightful. Have a great day!
