Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good, no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a sous chef so I tend to use AI to help manage my time. Basically if I have a list of things to do such as cook frittatas, chop veg, peel potatoes, prepare side salad then I will use AI to help me find the best order to do it in ie) chop veg whilst frittatas are cooking. I am relatively new to the job so I also use AI when I'm unsure on the best way to prepare something, like cutting a new kind of vegetable, as swell as using it to help me create new food combination ideas or presentation ideas.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using AI as both a time management tool and a culinary guide. When you're getting advice on preparing something new - like cutting that unfamiliar vegetable - how do you typically interact with the AI? Do you ask it questions and work through the technique step by step together, or do you more often ask for complete instructions upfront?

User: often complete instructions upfront. sometimes I will question the AI on this though, just to make sure its truly the best way.

AI: That makes sense - getting the full picture first, then digging deeper when needed. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I do prefer creation or presentation ideas to be from myself, it just feels more authentic and I do feel the benefit from trial and error.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - keeping the creative work for yourself while leveraging AI for the more logistical aspects. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others in the kitchen use it similarly, or have you encountered different attitudes about it?

User: I think the time management help was actually recommended to me by another sous chef. I don't find people have a bad attitude towards it. Although, around the creation of food and presentation side I think people are more skeptical. I guess people want those ideas to come from real people, which I do agree with to an extent.

AI: That's fascinating how there's this clear divide in acceptance - practical help is welcomed, but creative work is viewed differently. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time I was making a ganache to go on some chocolate eclairs and it kept running off and looking really messy. I asked AI what to do and it suggested to add more cream or wait a bit of time. The cream did not work which was frustrating but I ended up waiting for a while after and it did thicken up and worked.

AI: That's a great example of how the process can have ups and downs. It sounds like the AI gave you multiple options, but you had to work through which one actually applied to your situation.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I guess in the creative work section yes I think it could be a threat, but in the practical work no, it can't physically cook or prepare food (yet).

AI: That's a practical way to think about it - the physical skills remain uniquely yours. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll use it more, less, or differently as you gain more experience in the kitchen?

User: At the minute I think I'll use it the same way, perhaps even less when I get more familiar in the kitchen and better with time management. On the other hand though, when i'm trusted with more work load as well as more difficult stuff i'll end up going back to it again.

AI: That's really insightful - this idea that your AI usage might ebb and flow with your confidence and responsibilities.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that authentic creative element while still leveraging AI for practical support.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no that's great, thanks

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI fits into kitchen work - especially that distinction between practical support and creative authenticity - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
