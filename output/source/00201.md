Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you?

User: That sounds like a plan

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: My employer is still fairly restrictive on what we can use AI for. I do a lot of data analysis, and we aren't permitted to use it for data processing or analysis. We fairly frequently have to write out communications to the public, and I sometimes use AI to help structure the communications and to check for grammar, wording, etc.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like your workplace has some clear boundaries around AI use. 

When you do use AI to help with those public communications, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you work with the AI to structure and refine those communications?

User: Yeah sure. Typically that involves sending the whole letter (with some confidential information removed) and asking the AI to review the letter. Key things we want to focus on is making sure that the communication is well suited to a general public audience and understandable to the layman. So I'll ask it to review the wording, make sure it makes sense to a general audience, check the grammar, and make sure it's concise as well.

AI: That makes sense - translating technical content for a general audience can be really challenging. 

When the AI comes back with suggestions for making the communication more accessible or concise, how do you typically handle those recommendations? Do you find yourself accepting most of them, or do you often push back on certain suggestions?

User: I'd say it's probably about 50/50 in terms of accepting it or not. Though sometimes the change recommended may be directionally correct, so while I don't accept the change as is, it helps to me find a new way to word it.

AI: That's a really insightful way to work with it - using the AI's suggestions as a starting point even when they're not quite right. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Were it not for my employer's restrictions on using AI for data analysis, I might use it for that to provide some useful insights on data sets. However, my worry is that some of the insights may not be factually correct. This is why I tend to prefer AI use for structuring communications, or sometimes to brainstorm, but tend to avoid using it for anything that involves numbers or factuality.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making between different types of tasks. The concern about accuracy with numbers and factual content makes a lot of sense.

When you do use AI for brainstorming, what does that process look like for you? How do you approach those brainstorming sessions differently than when you're asking it to review communications?

User: Usually I would use the AI to help brainstorm different communications strategies aside from just letters (letters are required by law, but we can always go above and beyond to help stakeholders be more informed). So in some ways it's related to reviewing communications, as they both fall within the realm of communication, but are substantively different. 

Using it to brainstorm is usually asking for different ideas of how to communicate certain information to particularly stakeholders, but I primarily use it as a starting point.

AI: That's a smart approach - using it as a launching pad for your own thinking. It sounds like you've developed a pretty specific way of working with AI that fits within your workplace constraints.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed others approaching it similarly, or are there different perspectives around you?

User: I would say that my workplace is likely more skeptical of the use of AI than many in the private industry. Much of our work involves legal compliance following strictly worded laws, and I think there is a general worry that using AI may result in a reduction in quality or that it may result in communications or the like not meeting specific compliance requirements.

AI: That regulatory environment definitely creates a different dynamic around AI adoption. The stakes are much higher when legal compliance is on the line.

Given that cautious workplace culture, can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't get into the specifics too much, as fair amounts of it is confidential. That being said, there have been times that I've struggled to come up with the exact wording that sufficiently communicates a legal requirement to the recipient without being overly specific (as many of our communications go out to a variety of stakeholders that may be receiving the communications for different reasons). AI has been helpful on several occasions to workshop the specific wording, providing multiple different options for how to word a sentence or 2 that have been helpful.

AI: That sounds like a really valuable use case - finding that balance between being clear and comprehensive without overwhelming different audiences. It makes sense that having multiple wording options to choose from would be helpful in that kind of nuanced communication work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: At this moment I don't really think about that. I think that's likely a larger concern for those in private work, but working within the government I would think that the adoption of AI will likely be slower and more regulated, reducing the chances that it replaces me within the immediate future.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - the regulatory environment that creates restrictions now might also provide some job security in the long run.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think those workplace restrictions might change over time, or do you see yourself continuing to work within similar boundaries?

User: I would anticipate that we will be adopting the use of AI more in the future, albeit slowly. We handle very large amounts of data, and if we could leverage AI to more effectively process and analyze data I suspect that's something that would be hard to turn down. But things in government move slowly.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the potential efficiency gains with large datasets would be compelling, even in a cautious environment.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about navigating AI use within regulatory constraints. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI suggestions as a starting point rather than final answers, and how you've found that sweet spot for communication work while staying mindful of compliance requirements.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing that I can think of at the moment

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working with AI in a regulated government environment - especially how you balance leveraging AI's strengths while maintaining compliance and accuracy standards - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your thoughtful approach to AI use. Have a great rest of your day!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Take care!
