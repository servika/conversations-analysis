Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions! Let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I primarily use it for time-consuming research of existing, hard facts. For example, if I need a rundown of existing abnormal neurological conditions, I'll ask AI to present me a list of, say, 8-10 conditions and their main symptoms and causes. I don't request analysis or anything too "human." Instead, I ask it to find facts that, if I were to do the research myself, I would also find.

AI: That's a really clear way of thinking about it - focusing on factual research that you could do yourself but would take much longer. 

When you say you avoid asking for analysis or anything "too human," what draws that line for you? What makes you decide that a particular task should stay with you rather than going to AI?

User: If the AI's answer isn't something that would match every other person or models' responses, that's "too human," at least for this aspect of my AI use. So for example, I *will* use AI for a prompt like, "What are all of the movies in the 'Saw' franchise, plus quick plot summaries?" The list of "Saw" movies are concrete facts, and while the specific plot summaries may vary in wording from person-to-person or model-to-model, the actual plots themselves are also concrete facts.

For this aspect of my AI usage, I *won't* use it for a prompt like, "Describe the struggle someone with prosopagnosia may have in social situations, emphasizing the anxiety and fear they're experiencing, and why." While prosopagnosia (face blindness) has concrete symptoms that can be fact-checked, each person with the condition will experience different nuances in their fears and anxieties, and I don't want AI to explain *one person's* experience or attempt to internalize that human fear response.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction - you're essentially using AI as a research assistant for objective information while keeping subjective human experiences in your own domain. 

You mentioned "this aspect" of your AI usage a couple times. Does that suggest you use AI differently in other contexts or for other types of work?

User: Yes. This is where a gray area comes in. I have a strong aversion to AI being used for art and creativity, as it's a slippery slope from *helping* artists who have limited resources create their art (for example, an AI model detecting and removing background noise from an audio track for a low-budget indie film where the filmmakers couldn't afford a professional sound mixer) to the models being used in bad faith by those who could afford to hire, say, a voiceover artist, but instead choose to just use AI. 

The gray area comes in with writing. I will get stuck in a "perfectionist loop" when it comes to writing emails or crafting titles/descriptions for podcast episodes, which is a portion of my day job. In the past, it has taken me up to an hour to write one short email, as I'm constantly re-reading to try and figure out what the tone is and how it could potentially be misinterpreted by the recipient. In this case, I'll feed the model what I want to say, since this is the useful part of my brain. I then have it take over once the "perfectionist loop" (not useful) part of my brain kicks in, since that perfectionist loop is wasting time.

AI: That's really insightful - you're using AI to break through a specific cognitive block that's interfering with your productivity, while being very intentional about preserving the creative and meaningful parts for yourself.

When you're in one of those perfectionist loops with an email, can you walk me through what that interaction with AI typically looks like? Are you collaborating back and forth with it, or do you hand it off completely once you hit that stuck point?

User: It's collaborative, with me tweaking the AI's response. So it typically looks like this:

Me - Please make this sound more professional and less angry, but also less apologetic. I'm trying to walk the line between sounding confident while also being a team-player, but also someone who can't be fucked with. 
[REDACTED]

AI - Here's a rewrite that perfectly threads the needle of "flexible-yet-confident."
[REDACTED]
What do you think? Do you want a little more flexibility, or is this the vibe you're going for?

Me - Here's my updated edit. What do you think? Is this too apologetic?
[REDACTED]*

And back and forth like that.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like a really effective way to work through those perfectionist spirals. You're keeping control of the message content and final decisions while using AI as a sounding board.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people at your job talk openly about using it, or is it more of a personal workflow choice?

User: It's very much a personal workflow choice. I work with almost all creatives, and AI is a sensitive issue. The general attitude among my colleagues (which I share) is similar to the one I outlined above, and we'll share tips in that vein: concrete, time-consuming jobs that we *could* do but are better delegated to a machine so that we have more time to focus on the creative aspects of our jobs. Or, as with the above example, tips for ways that AI can help our individual blocks.

AI: It sounds like there's a thoughtful, almost careful approach to AI use in your creative workplace - focusing on preserving the human creative work while being strategic about where AI can genuinely help.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: YES. I was working on a for-hire gig, and I had to write a very sensitive email to my contact at the company that hired me. I felt that he had overstepped a boundary and I needed to explain how he had overstepped, why I was upset, and how I felt we should proceed for the remainder of the project. I was using the AI model to finesse the email itself, but I was also constantly double-checking with the model, asking if this was appropriate or if my perspective was off-base or out-of-line. It was reassuring me that the email tone was professional, I was being reasonable, etc. Turns out, I was *way* off, the tone was *not* professional, and the model was erring on the side of agreeing with the user (me) rather than providing a truly impartial viewpoint. Shame on me for not understanding the model's limitations (this was before I understood much about AI), but the situation definitely left me frustrated.

AI: That's a really important example - it sounds like you discovered the hard way that AI can have blind spots around giving genuine pushback or challenging your perspective, especially in interpersonally complex situations.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: What areas do you mean for "take over"? Like, am I improving my ability to handle mental blocks and write emails? Or are you referencing more creative work?

AI: I'm curious about your perspective on both, actually. You mentioned using AI to help with those perfectionist loops in email writing - do you think about whether you want to keep building your own skills in that area? And also, given your work with creatives, how do you think about skill development in areas where AI capabilities are expanding?

User: I actively pay attention to the changes that AI makes to my emails, for example, so that I can add those wording and stylistic choices to my arsenal. And yes, I'm constantly working to improve the creative aspects of my work so that, even if I can't match the speed at which AI can do my job, I can at least match its quality and surpass its creativity.

AI: That's a really proactive approach - treating AI as a learning tool while doubling down on developing your uniquely creative skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology develops, or do you think you'll maintain these same boundaries and approaches?

User: My relationship with AI will definitely change as the tech develops. The more integrated it becomes with work tools, for example, the more I'll use it. Having AI write and send emails (that can't offend someone!), such as scheduling a meeting or thanking someone for sending a file, will only make my life easier. I have unread emails from 2008, so a model being able to go through them and automatically delete everything from specific senders, with specific keywords, etc. would be fantastic. And until concrete safeguards are put in place regarding the creative side so that artists aren't even more devalued than they currently are, I don't see myself starting to use it for things like image/video generation, fictional storytelling, etc. 

An example: I'm excited to see the technology develop to better edit images on a large scale. If I take several dozen photos of the same area but from different angles, AI's ability to edit out the same building despite the different camera angles would be awesome. I *could* do it myself, but it would take hours. But I won't use AI to create a brand new image from scratch.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your clear framework for distinguishing between objective research tasks and subjective human experiences, and how you're using AI to work around specific cognitive blocks while actively learning from those interactions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, that's it! Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining those careful boundaries while still leveraging AI strategically - especially in a creative workplace where these conversations can be sensitive - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
