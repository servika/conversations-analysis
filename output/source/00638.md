Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope lets get started

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to summarize long documents, write emails, rewrite content for different audiences, search the web for policy or reports, turn meeting notes into useful documents, amke powerpoint content

AI: That's a solid range of tasks you're covering. I'm particularly curious about one you mentioned - when you say you rewrite content for different audiences, what does that process look like for you?

User: well i work with a variety of stakeholders from different industries, as well as internal to our organization or government in general. If we are releasing a new policy and we have to create key messages for it, we would communicate that differently depending on the stakeholder

AI: That makes a lot of sense - tailoring the message to who's receiving it. When you're working with AI to adapt those key messages, how do you typically approach that? Do you give it the original policy content and ask it to rewrite for specific groups, or is your process different?

User: Well I might use AI to generate the key messages or bulletin to begin with, then once I am satisfied with the content, I would ask AI to rewrite it for a different stakeholder audience. I would include information about the stakeholder in my prompt as well as how I would want it to sound

AI: That's helpful - so you're building on the AI's work in layers. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, I use AI for idea or content generation but not for actually putting it into the policy or report templates, it usually doesn't do the formatting or additions correctly and its easier to do it myself

AI: That's interesting - so you draw the line at the formatting and template work. Tell me more about what goes wrong when AI tries to handle those structural elements.

User: it just changes the formatting, sometimes adds the wrong things in the wrong places, stuff like that

AI: Got it - sounds like the AI gets the content right but struggles with the precise structural requirements. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: i collaborate throughout a task

AI: What does that collaboration look like in practice? Can you walk me through how that back-and-forth typically unfolds during one of your tasks?

User: My prompts usually start more broad, and i narrow down based on the feedback I get. I will upload documents for context

AI: So you're starting broad and then iterating based on what comes back. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My workplace has many people who are of an older demographic and not confident using the AI assistants. Often managers ask for things they think would be challenging that I can get AI to handle in a matter of minutes and are always very impressed with the results. I would say the culture is hesitant to adopt it and so sometimes I feel like I am one of the only ones using it regularly

AI: That's a really interesting dynamic - being the go-to person for AI capabilities while others remain hesitant. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A director reached out to see if I could locate a report that was mentioned in a meeting, she only had a few keywords about it. I was able to use the AI assistant to locate the report, as well as provide a summary with a focus on the aspects of the report that pertained to our business and location. I handled this request and provided the summary to her within only a few minutes. This is something that would have been a few hours of work without using AI assistant so that was very satisfying.

AI: That sounds like a real win - turning hours of searching and analysis into minutes. What made that particular situation work so well with the AI? Was it the web search capability, or something else about how you approached it?

User: It was a couple of things, first it was the web search capability in finding the report. Then, it was the AI's ability to scan the long report and synthesize the content, and lastly the AI's knowledge of my workplace and location and using that stored memory to produce the targeted/relevant summarized content.

AI: That's a great example of how multiple AI capabilities came together effectively. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: oh yes absolutely, AI could easily replace many aspects of my job

AI: That's pretty candid. When you think about AI potentially replacing aspects of your job, how does that sit with you? What goes through your mind about that possibility?

User: It does give me a bit of unease, however as I mentioned my organization is a slower to adapt workplace, so it would not be any time soon. I also expect much of the kind of work many of us do will shift and adapt over time, integrating the AI assistants and employees taking on new and different tasks

AI: That's a thoughtful way to look at it - seeing it as an evolution rather than replacement. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see it becoming much more commonplace and used by everyone throughout the day for all kinds of tasks big and small, in the same way email is. I see it being integrating into various aspects, email, word documents, presentations, etc

AI: That's an interesting comparison to email - something that just becomes woven into the fabric of how work gets done. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being an early adopter in a more hesitant workplace and how you're thinking about the evolution of work rather than just replacement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Broadly speaking, I see AI as an inevitable integration into every aspect of our lives, revolutionizing the way we work and live. By learning how to maximize the benefits of it, while maintaining our human ability to think critically and maintain networks/relationships, I think it will be a wonderful new way of working. I absolutely love having AI as a tool at work. What I think is also really important to consider in the workplace in terms of AI, is to use it less for doing your work for you, and more for teaching you skills you need to imprive yourself in your field. If we start using AI more to learn rather than to just "do our work for us" we can broaden our minds and enable ourselves to work alongside AI in new and exciting ways we may not even be able to comprehend yet.

AI: That's a really insightful way to frame it - using AI as a learning partner rather than just a task executor. The distinction you're making between having AI do the work versus having it teach you skills seems like it could be crucial for how people adapt and grow alongside these tools.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about being an early adopter, the collaborative approach you've developed, and especially your perspective on using AI as a learning tool rather than just a replacement will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
