Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I will use it for tech support brainstorming usually

AI: Tell me more about that tech support brainstorming. What does that process look like for you?

User: When an end user calls me for help with an IT issue, I will use AI to troubleshoot, by sending a prompt with the error message for example, to get ideas on troubleshooting steps, causes, or resolutions

AI: That's really helpful to understand. When you get those troubleshooting ideas from AI, how do you typically work with them? Do you follow the suggestions step by step, or do you use them more as a starting point for your own problem-solving?

User: I'll skim the ideas and pick an choose which ones sound the most legit

AI: Interesting - so you're filtering through the AI's suggestions based on what sounds legitimate to you. What helps you determine which troubleshooting ideas sound most legit? Is it your prior experience, or are there other factors you consider?

User: my prior experience and the likelihood of certain ideas being correct

AI: That makes sense - you're using your expertise to evaluate the AI's suggestions. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your IT support work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: If AI could create ticket templates, I would also use that -- our AI at work is a proprietary one, and it works with ServiceNow to tell me when tickets assigned to me have closed for example, and I can use the AI to link with the ticketing system

AI: So you're already using AI integration with your ticketing system - that's fascinating. When you mentioned you'd use AI for ticket templates if it could do that, what draws you to that idea? And thinking more broadly, are there parts of your IT support work where you think "I'd rather handle this myself" even if AI could assist?

User: I'd like the AI to add troubleshooting steps into the body of the ticket itself, so less typing, and better documentation

AI: That sounds like it would save you significant time on documentation. When you use AI for troubleshooting brainstorming now - either with the proprietary system at work or other AI tools - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout solving a problem, or do you tend to give it the error message once and then work independently with those suggestions?

User: I'll usually ask for all of the causes just once

AI: So you prefer to get a comprehensive list upfront rather than having an ongoing conversation. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others on your IT team use it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: Yes everyone, even the managers are starting to encourage using AI

AI: That's interesting that it's becoming encouraged from the top down. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can use the proprietary AI to access forms or HR documents and I've used this to find a form to look up the AI policies, which was satisfying that it helps find things that were previously very difficult to find

AI: That's a great example of AI solving a real pain point - finding information that was buried in your system. On the flip side, have you had any experiences with AI at work that left you feeling frustrated or like it wasn't quite working the way you needed it to?

User: AI is integrated into Microsoft teams and sometimes the auto reminders for tickets being closed are too much, too many notifications

AI: So the integration can be a bit overwhelming with notifications - that's a useful insight. How do you think about maintaining your technical troubleshooting skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I consider AI a useful tool, and I can't troubleshoot without tools

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - thinking of AI as just another tool in your toolkit rather than a replacement. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in the coming months or years?

User: I expect to use AI as a tool permanently

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on viewing AI as just another essential tool in your troubleshooting toolkit, much like any other IT tool you rely on.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's good for now

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI fits into IT support work - from troubleshooting brainstorming to document retrieval to ticketing system integration - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
