Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Sure, I work as a seamstress, a project usually begins from the moment a customer comes to the store. I take measurements, if I'm currently working in store, if I am working from home then I just pick up garments and measurements from store.

AI: That's really interesting - so you work both in-store with direct customer interaction and from home. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI to run through ideas I have about certain projects, more so to have a trailing thought process and receive some feedback from it. If I am working in store, I tend not to use it as much because I can talk to colleagues about concerns or confusion.

AI: That's fascinating - so AI serves almost like a thinking partner when you're working solo. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: My most recent project, where I used AI, was to do some basic maths. I was tied up and used handsfree to ask for conversions. One of the given measurements was in a different unit to the rest, I asked for a conversion and briefly, for reasoning, to see if the new measurement in the new unit was on trend for the rest of the garment.

AI: That's a really practical example - using AI hands-free for unit conversions and getting that quick sanity check on whether the measurement seemed right for the garment.

When you're working with AI in situations like this, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I definitely feel in control of the creative decisions. The AI feels like an assistant rather than a director. Sometimes it feels like a partner due to its helpfulness but the majority of the time it helps in the ways I expect it to and doesn't push too far.

AI: That's a great way to put it - an assistant that sometimes feels like a partner. You mentioned it "doesn't push too far" - that suggests there's a balance you appreciate.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Um, I think my work has been smoother. Especially working from home, it can be isolating and you sometimes question your decisions. Working in store, like I previously said, I can run things by my colleagues but working from home I do not have that option for a second opinion. Having AI so readily available has helped my confidence when working alone. The majority of the time my calculations are correct, so having AI reiterate that builds my confidence enough to feel as though I can trust my instincts.

AI: That confidence boost sounds really valuable - having that reassurance when you're working in isolation. It sounds like AI is helping validate your existing expertise rather than replacing it.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm not sure I have any. I suppose when I first started using it I was apprehensive about its abilities and needed to double check its maths for peace of mind, but I have found that it is always accurate so this is no longer a concern for me.

AI: It sounds like your initial caution actually helped you build trust in the tool through experience. That's interesting that the accuracy has been consistently reliable for you.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I'll talk about how I, personally, think it would be helpful to evolve. Currently, there's not much more AI can do to help in my field as my job is very physical and, of course, an AI cannot help with that. However, in seamstressing as a whole, I feel that if the AI's understanding of space and connection improved, it could help in other areas such as pattern making. Currently, I have to buy patterns or make them myself in store, if AI were able to create a multipiece pattern spread out across printable A4 paper, that could be assembled once printed from a home printer, this would change the game for me.

AI: That's a really thoughtful vision - AI helping with the spatial and technical aspects like pattern making while you maintain the hands-on craftsmanship. The idea of AI creating patterns that could be printed at home and assembled sounds like it would really expand your capabilities when working remotely.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as that confidence-building partner when you're working alone, and your vision for how pattern-making assistance could be a game-changer.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's all.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI as a confidence-building assistant, the importance of that validation when working in isolation, and your vision for spatial understanding in pattern-making will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you shared both your practical uses of AI and your thoughtful perspective on where it could evolve in your field. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
