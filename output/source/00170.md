Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for drafting papers, creating research plans, organizing my day, drafting emails, and doing deep research as a start to my literature review into topics

AI: That's quite a range of uses across different aspects of your work. When you mention drafting papers, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: I generally create a draft on my own, ask AI if the draft is good and suggestions on how to improve it, then repeat this process until i am happy with the draft and can take it from there on my own

AI: That's an interesting iterative approach. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, some tasks I prefer to handle myself, such as math tasks or writing tasks where I need to use personal experience. For math tasks, I find it more fun to do it on my own, and for writing tasks that are personal, I find I am better at expressing myself than the AI

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you distinguish between tasks based on both enjoyment and personal authenticity. When you do use AI for work, like with those paper drafts you mentioned, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with it throughout a task

AI: Can you tell me more about what that collaboration looks like in practice? How do you typically go back and forth with the AI during a task?

User: Like I said, I create a draft on my own, ask for feedback, corrections, or improvements, and iterate from there going back and forth between my own work and the AI suggestions

AI: That makes sense for your writing process. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My work place culture at a college encourages us to use AI to check our work but not to take over the creative and innovative research process

AI: That's an interesting distinction your college makes. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When I used it to create a python program to process my data, it was very satisfying because it saved a lot of time processing my data

AI: What made that experience particularly satisfying beyond just the time savings? Was there something about how the collaboration worked or what you were able to accomplish that stood out?

User: I would have taken a week or more to learn the python skills necessary and design ideas to create the program, whereas with AI I could make the program and use my current programming skills to check the program and make corrections

AI: That's a powerful example of AI amplifying your existing skills. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: i consider it, but am not actively working on it

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think i will rely more and more on it until it is most of my job

AI: That's a striking vision of the future. Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you leverage existing skills rather than replace them entirely, like with that Python programming example.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: nothing else. thanks

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the iterative collaboration process, the distinction between tasks you prefer to keep personal versus those where AI adds value, and your thoughtful approach to skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
