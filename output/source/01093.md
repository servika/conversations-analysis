Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, thank you.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As a graphic designer, I undertake a lot of different creative projects. When I'm contacted by a client, I always ask a set series of questions to better understand what the client is looking for in their design project. This includes budget, target market, timeline, general information about their business, previous branding, goals, competitors, preferred colours, preferred fonts, preferred design elements, etc. I then use this as the basis of formulating ideas for their projects. I use AI to input these details, and ask AI to come up with a plan outline that I can follow. I also use AI to generate ideas that I can potentially build on. I essentially use AI to help me brainstorm ideas and help me get through the bottleneck of creativity so I can continue with creating designs for the clients.

I also use AI for email responses, and am starting to try to implement automation for this, so when I get an initial email from a client, an automatic response is created, which includes a link to my brand identity questionnaire, and is saved in my drafts so I can tweak it and send.

AI: That's fascinating how you've integrated AI into both your creative process and client communication workflow. 

Tell me more about that creative bottleneck you mentioned. What does that typically look like for you when it happens, and how does AI help you move through it?

User: The creative bottleneck can occur when a client doesn't give too much information, or when it's a difficult project that takes a lot of brain power to find an effective solution. Since college, this process has always been done with a sketch book and a pencil to brainstorm ideas and can be a lengthy process. Using AI has definitely helped to make this stage of a project much shorter for me. It gives me useful ideas to use as a foundation, and then I take these ideas and develop them, again, with a pencil and sketchbook, but AI takes a lot of the burden away, and ultimately helps me deliver the best possible outcome I can to my clients.

AI: It sounds like AI has become a valuable thinking partner for you in that initial ideation phase. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, traditionally this has been emailing. I've always preferred to respond to emails myself because I have felt like they're more personable, but as AI has improved, and as my trust in AI has grown, I've started to use AI generated responses more and more, that I can tweak. Still, I handle all of my accounting myself, even though I recognise that AI could help with that, but I'm starting to consider using AI to streamline this too.

AI: That's really interesting how your trust and comfort level has evolved, especially with something as personal as client emails. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: With the creative aspect, I'm delegating initially, so that AI can come up with ideas, and then as the project goes on I'm collaborating more, meaning when I have ideas of how to develop designs, I'm conversing with AI about my ideas and asking for thoughts on how I can maximise its effectiveness, and seeking input on anything I've overlooked.

AI: That's a really clear picture of how your interaction with AI shifts throughout a project - starting with delegation for that initial spark, then moving into more of a collaborative dialogue as you develop your ideas.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: For me, I work solo, so my workplace culture shifting is purely personal to how it's affected me.

AI: Ah, that makes sense - as a solo graphic designer, you have the freedom to shape your own approach to AI without external workplace pressures.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes, when I first started out as a solo graphic designer after leaving my employed role, I needed to write a business plan, which felt daunting, and I wanted to get it done quickly so I could focus on growing and finding clients. I used AI to help me write my business plan, and this made the whole process so much simpler and quicker, and the final business plan that I had was really high quality. This was very satisfying indeed.

AI: That sounds like such a pivotal moment - using AI to tackle something that felt overwhelming so you could focus on what you do best. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: In graphic design, this has been something I've considered as design is one area that AI does have the potential to take over. My design skills are always maintained because I am still coming up with them myself, using some of AI's creative input. When I do use AI for creative inspiration, I always try to assess and understand why the ideas work, and I see this as a learning process, which, if anything, will improve my creativity.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using AI as a learning tool to understand the "why" behind effective ideas. It sounds like you're actively strengthening your creative foundation even as you leverage AI's capabilities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I am always trying to learn about capabilities of AI so I can implement new things and can work as effectively as possible. I am currently creating a HTML app through AI that I can use in my browser which will track my hours and automatically log them so I can invoice clients correctly. I see this saving lots of time and allowing me to focus more on the design side of things. This has happened because I've recently learned about this capability of AI, and I see my relationship with AI evolving in exactly this way. Learning about what can be achieved, and implementing it as I go, so as to maximise my efficiency.

AI: That HTML app project is a perfect example of how you're expanding AI's role beyond creative tasks into operational efficiency. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you use AI as both a creative partner and a learning tool - assessing why ideas work to strengthen your own creative foundation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's covered everything. I very much look forward to continuing to learn and collaborate with AI in the future.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. It's been really valuable to hear how you've thoughtfully integrated AI into your creative process while maintaining and even strengthening your core design skills.

I hope your HTML time-tracking app project goes well, and best of luck with your continued growth as a solo designer!
