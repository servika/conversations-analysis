Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, thank you

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't really use it on a typical workday. I've tried AI for some routine tasks like writing/summarizing emails but found that it made so many mistakes it actually wasn't saving me time. So I don't use it daily - more for special tasks.

AI: That's really interesting that the daily applications didn't work out as expected. 

Tell me more about these special tasks where you do find AI useful. What makes those situations different?

User: When I was hiring a new program coordinator, a used AI to draft a job ad. It did a surprisingly good job and I was able to tweak it and use it. It saved me a lot of time. Another time my office was hosting a series of special trainings for our new LMS. I used AI to format the schedule - like color-coded topics on a time table. That was also really helpful and saved me a lot of time. It seems like when I need to do something more complex AI is not helpful. With basic tasks it can save me time.

AI: That's a helpful distinction you're drawing between the complexity levels. It sounds like AI worked well for the job ad drafting and schedule formatting, but not for more complex work.

When you say AI isn't helpful with more complex tasks, can you give me an example of what you mean by complex? What happened when you tried to use it for something more involved?

User: I had drafted a survey for a research study and I need to set it up in Qualtrics. It had a few questions that needed tables, room for multiple answers, etc - so not just straight text questions. I don't know Qualtrics very well and asked AI to walk me through setting it up, sharing my draft with it. It was such a waste of time because AI kept asking me to do things that were either incorrect or options that didn't exist in Qualtrics. I would tell it that an option didn't exist and it couldn't get me to a right answer.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you're working with software you're not familiar with and the AI is giving you steps that don't actually exist.

When you hit those roadblocks with the Qualtrics setup, how did you end up resolving it? Did you abandon the AI approach entirely, or did you try a different way of working with it?

User: I abandoned AI after multiple attempts to correct it. I believe it concluded that I couldn't set up certain questions the way I needed to in Qualtrics. So I read Qualtrics help articles instead and was able to figure it out.

AI: That's a really clear example of where the AI approach broke down completely. It sounds like the help articles were actually more reliable for that technical, software-specific guidance.

I'm curious about your decision-making process now. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes you choose to do something yourself versus trying AI first?

User: I prefer to do email myself. I actually tried AI to write some basic emails or summarize some emails. And it did a poor job with tone (too formal and wordy) and sometimes got information wrong. I find it is quicker and more reliable to just do email myself.

AI: That makes sense - tone and accuracy are so important in email communication, and it sounds like the AI wasn't capturing your voice or getting the details right.

When you do use AI for work - like with that job ad or schedule formatting - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it back and forth throughout the task, or do you tend to give it the full request upfront and let it handle it independently?

User: For the job ad, I gave it the full request and then made a few edits independently. When I made the schedule, I did collaborate back and forth to make some formatting changes until it looked the way I wanted it

AI: Interesting - so it varies depending on the task. The job ad was more of a "here's what I need, go do it" approach, while the schedule involved more back-and-forth collaboration to get the formatting just right.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it much, or have you noticed any particular attitudes toward using these tools?

User: People talk about it a lot because I work at a university. So faculty are often frustrated with AI because students use it to cheat. Other faculty have found cool ways to collaborate with AI in their course design. But I don't feel that my workplace culture has influenced the way I use it.

AI: That's fascinating that you're in an environment where AI is such a hot topic, but it hasn't really shaped your own usage patterns. It sounds like you've developed your own approach based on what works for you practically.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think the examples I already shared work best here. The attempt to make a survey in Qualtrics was particularly frustrating because AI kept giving me the wrong steps. I ended up more confused by using AI in that situation. The job ad examples was satisfying because I hate looking at a blank screen when needing to write administrative documents. So the fact that AI generated a good draft of the job ad made me happy.

AI: That blank screen problem really resonates - having that initial draft to work from instead of starting from nothing sounds like it made a real difference for you.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it not really factor into your decisions about when to use AI?

User: It doesn't factor in right now. I work with faculty on complex topics in teaching and learning. Yes, AI could eventually create some trainings that my staff currently craft. But there is enough complex thinking and human interaction in my job that I'm not very concerned.

AI: That confidence in the human-centered aspects of your role makes a lot of sense, especially given the complex faculty work you're describing.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it more, differently, or keeping it about the same as it is now?

User: I hope to use it more as it evolves. Right now, I don't really trust AI to do important tasks like data analysis or summaries of complex documents. Once it can do these things well then I see myself using it more.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your clear examples of where AI succeeds versus where it falls short, and how you've developed a pretty pragmatic approach based on reliability and time-saving.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the importance of reliability, the distinction between simple and complex tasks, and how trust plays into AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
