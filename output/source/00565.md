Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Let's start.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI for research. It's a great way to get quick answers to all kinds of questions and find websites that can offer more information. I am a teacher, so I particularly like this tool when students ask random questions to which I'm unsure of the answer. It's a great way to start the research process.

AI: That sounds like a really practical application, especially for handling those unexpected student questions that come up. 

When you say you use it to start the research process, could you walk me through what that typically looks like? How do you go from that initial AI interaction to feeling confident about the information you're sharing with your students?

User: I know that AI isn't always correct so I'll use AI answers to give me an initial impression of the right answer and then I use the links provided to double check the accuracy on my own. AI combined with my double checking is what gives me the confidence to then share the answer with my students. I'm also just starting to use an AI tool to assess my student's literacy skills and progress, though I don't have a lot of experience with that too, yet.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using AI as a starting point but then verifying through your own research. It sounds like you've developed a system that works well for those in-the-moment questions.

Tell me more about this literacy assessment tool you're starting to explore. What drew you to try that, and how has the experience been so far?

User: It's very new to me. It's a platform called Amira that's actually being used by my state for our standardized reading tests. It also includes reading instruction. I'm just getting started with it, so I don't have a lot of experience to share. My colleagues who have worked with it say it's very adaptable to the individual student and even adjusts to the student's speech patterns. This is important because some kids have pronunciation issue that less advanced technology might flag as a reading issue.

AI: That's fascinating - the ability to adapt to individual speech patterns sounds like it could make a real difference for students who might otherwise be misassessed.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to handle creative tasks myself. I prefer to handle creative tasks myself because I enjoy doing them and I don't want them to sound formulaic. I may ask AI to help with idea generation. I also prefer to draft my own emails and parent communication so that I can ensure it is in my voice.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining your authentic voice in communications with parents sounds particularly important in your role.

When you do use AI for idea generation on those creative tasks, could you describe how that interaction typically goes? Are you bouncing ideas back and forth with the AI, or is it more like getting an initial spark and then you take it from there?

User: I like to get the initial spark and then take it from there. I used to (and sometimes still do) perform a Google search or check Pinterest for the initial spark, but those searches can be inexact and often don't yield something with quite the nuances I'm looking for. I like that AI is more multi-faceted and conversational than a traditional Google search.

AI: That's a really interesting comparison - the conversational aspect and ability to capture nuances that a traditional search might miss. It sounds like AI gives you more targeted starting points.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people generally open to it, cautious, or is there a mix of approaches?

User: There is definitely a mix. As with any new technology, there tends to be an age gap, with younger people embracing it in larger numbers than older people. There are definitely people who worry that AI will replace their jobs. There is a big push in my workplace and at the higher levels for teachers to get specialized training on how to use AI with students and in the classroom. My colleagues who use AI use it to rewrite articles at different reading levels for differentiated instruction, generate lesson plans, draft parent communication, and even create fun images to use in slideshows. Sometimes the image generation is simply used as an ice breaker because AI images can sometimes have humorous errors.

AI: That's a great snapshot of how different people are approaching it. The humorous errors in image generation as icebreakers is particularly interesting!

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The one thing I find frustrating about AI tools on various platforms is how they are constantly popping up and disrupting my workflow in order to ask me if they can help.

AI: That's a really specific frustration - those constant interruptions could definitely break your concentration and disrupt your flow, especially when you're trying to focus on teaching or lesson planning.

On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI felt particularly satisfying or successful? What made that experience stand out?

User: I had a student safety issue that I was kind of stumped on how to deal with so I asked AI to generate a series of reading articles on the subject. The articles perfectly captured what I was trying to communicate to the student. I was able to assign them as reading, along with comprehension questions also generated. That was a very satisfying experience.

AI: That sounds like it was exactly what you needed in a sensitive situation - being able to communicate important information in just the right way for your student.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do sometimes think about that. I am a computer and creative person and AI is able to generate everything I can generate but in less time. I'll be honest, when this new reading program was introduced, it felt a little bit like the beginning of the end. I suppose I figure I just need to find ways to work with AI in order to be more efficient at my job and continue providing the human element.

AI: That's a really honest reflection. The "beginning of the end" feeling when the reading program was introduced sounds like it hit particularly close to home.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see yourself heading with these tools?

User: I'm currently somewhere in the middle as far has how much I use the tools compared to my colleagues. I see myself using the tools more frequently to support differentiated instruction and lesson planning. I would also like to explore how I can incorporate AI into my classroom so students are learning how to effectively utilize it and all the ways they can utilize it. I have learning to do in this area.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your honest perspective about that "beginning of the end" feeling with the reading program, and how you're navigating the balance between efficiency and maintaining that essential human element in teaching.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope. I don't have anything else to add.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research starting point, the importance of maintaining your authentic voice in communications, and your thoughtful approach to integrating these tools while preserving the human elements of teaching will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your candor about both the benefits and the challenges you've encountered. Have a great rest of your day!

User: You, too!

AI: Thank you! Take care!
