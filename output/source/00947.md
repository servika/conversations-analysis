Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I'm ready.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a teacher. I mainly use AI for admin tasks to help me save time. I've used it to help me draft lesson plans, come up with ideas for lessons, and to help me write reports.

AI: That sounds like AI is helping you with some of the more time-consuming parts of teaching. When you say you use it to help draft lesson plans, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How do you typically approach that process?

User: I ask the AI to make a lesson plan on a given topic and age level. I ask it to format it in the lesson plan style I want. For example, it must include a starter activity, the main part of a lesson, activities, any assessment criteria, and a plenary activity. I tell it how long each section of the lesson must be. Once the AI generates the lesson plan, I often edit it or tweak it to how I want the final plan to be.

AI: That's a really clear process. When you get to that editing and tweaking stage, what kinds of changes do you typically find yourself making to what the AI has generated?

User: Usually it will be things like adjusting the difficulty level to better suit my students. I might also change the wording. I might take the AI's ideas as a base and then build upon them. Things like that.

AI: That makes sense - you're really tailoring it to your specific classroom. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Some teachers use AI to help them mark work. I prefer to mark myself. I think marking is something that only a human can do thoroughly. There are often little subtleties and subjective judgements involved in marking that an AI might miss. Maybe for subjects that have a definite right or wrong answer (like maths), AI is a better fit for marking. But essay-based, discursive subjects (like history) are probably always going to be best marked by a teacher.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making about the nature of different subjects and assessment. When you're marking those essay-based assignments in history, what are some of those subtleties or subjective judgments that you feel are important for you to capture as the human teacher?

User: Things like how well the student has applied their knowledge of facts to critically form an argument or a discussion about a topic.

AI: That's a really nuanced skill to evaluate. When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It depends what the task is. I mostly use it in a collaborative way. For example, I'll give it information about a student and then ask it to write a report. But the first attempt isn't usually the one I'll use. Often I will need to ask the AI to add more, or edit what it wrote myself.

AI: That iterative back-and-forth sounds like a real collaboration. When you're working on those student reports and asking the AI to add more, what kinds of things are you usually asking it to expand on or adjust?

User: Usually it will be things like a change of wording.

AI: I see. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I've noticed that some of my colleagues are hesitant to use AI to help them with their work. I think it has a lot to do with the thought that it might be seen as ''cheating'' in a way.

AI: That's an interesting perspective about the "cheating" concern. How do you think about that yourself - do you see using AI as fundamentally different from other tools teachers might use to help with their work?

User: I don't view it as cheating at all. I embrace the time-saving aspect of it. I think giving the menial, tedious, time-consuming jobs to AI frees teachers up for the more ''human'' aspects of the job. The fun, creative, more worthwhile and valuable aspects. Using AI as a time-saving tool could help teachers be better teachers, I think.

AI: That's a compelling way to think about it - using AI to handle certain tasks so you can focus on the more human-centered parts of teaching. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't really think of a specific situation right now. I use AI, but not extensively. I probably should use it more though!

AI: That's fair - sometimes these things blend together in our daily routines. You mentioned you probably should use it more. What's holding you back from using it more extensively? Is it about finding the right opportunities, or something else?

User: I don't know. Probably just old habits. And learning how to use it to its full potential, that will probably take some time. The more I learn about it, the more I'll probably use it. It may be something that gradually increases over time.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it's a gradual learning process. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I haven't actually actively considered this. I think AI has the potential to change the education sector a lot, but I don't think it'll ever fully replace human teachers. But maybe I'm wrong!

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I will probably use it more and more over time. Maybe in the near future, AI will also become part of the curriculum and we will have to teach students how to use it appropriately.

AI: That's a really interesting point about potentially teaching students how to use AI appropriately. Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI can free teachers up for the more human, creative aspects of teaching.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of right now. Thanks for interviewing me.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative tool while maintaining the human elements that are essential to teaching have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. 

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
