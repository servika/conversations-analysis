Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, no questions from me

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a casting director. Typically, I use AI in my work to help me sift through a large database of actors to pinpoint which one would be best for a specific job. It's pretty helpful and saves me some time, but I definitely get the final say in who gets picked

AI: That sounds like a really interesting application - using AI to help narrow down from what I imagine must be thousands of potential actors. 

When you say you use it to "sift through" your database, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How does the AI help you identify which actors might be the best fit?

User: When I get details for a new project, I briefly chat with the director about their vision for the characters, but most of the time, I have a lot of creative freedom. So I jot down some bullets of the kind of actor that seems best for a part (height, color, general demeanor + vibe, etc). The database is pretty old-school, so I'm not able to put too many filters on it as is, so I'm normally going through thousands of prospects before I gather a small group of people I'll then reach out to for an audition. With the help of AI, I can specify what I'm looking for (most of the actors' profiles are pretty detailed, thankfully), and it helps me narrow down the pool a lot faster

AI: That's fascinating - so the AI is essentially acting as a much more sophisticated filter system than what your database originally offered. 

Tell me more about how you communicate those specifications to the AI. When you mention things like "general demeanor and vibe" - how do you translate those sometimes abstract qualities into something the AI can work with?

User: I guess I just try to be as detailed as possible, bringing in comparisons to other actors and characters from movies where I can if I can't quite explain what exactly I'm looking for. Honestly, I still do a lot of the legwork, because you really have to meet a lot of these people in person to know whether they're a great fit or not. That isn't really something you can always put into words

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's clearly something about the human element and in-person chemistry that can't be captured digitally. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you still do a lot of the legwork and get the final say. Are there certain parts of the casting process you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I really love what I do, so there aren't too many tasks I choose to delegate to AI. I guess just if something is super repetitive and tedious (like putting out casting calls and scheduling auditions), that's something I could use help with

AI: It sounds like you have a real passion for the creative and human-centered aspects of your work. 

When you do use AI for those more repetitive tasks like scheduling auditions, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it step-by-step throughout the process, or do you tend to give it the full task and let it handle it independently?

User: I definitely let it handle schedules alone (I'll just check every once in a while to make sure everything seems feasible). But with stuff related to filtering the database, we do feel like more of a team

AI: That's a really interesting distinction - treating AI as more independent for administrative tasks but as a collaborative partner for the creative filtering work.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in casting using similar approaches, or have you developed this workflow on your own?

User: Yeah, I'd say what I do isn't unique at all, AI is in everything now. It's tricky in entertainment spaces because there are a lot of strong opinions on whether we should use AI in any capacity

AI: That tension you mention in entertainment spaces sounds really complex - having strong opinions about AI use while also finding practical benefits from it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A lot of AI-related satisfaction comes from that fast turnaround with casting! I love getting to save time gathering a group of people with basic qualities that I'm looking for to then really get to dive into their profiles. Even with auditions, I'm not as pressed for time now, so I feel like I can really get to know the actors and not rush them out the door asap

AI: That's a great example of how the time savings translates into better quality interactions with the actors themselves. It sounds like AI is helping you focus more on the parts of your job you find most meaningful.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I mean yeah, it's scary to think that my job could be fully automated one day. But I really don't think AI will ever be able to fully understand and feel chemistry between two actors like a person can. If my job was taken over by AI, I think movies would get a lot worse

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - the idea that human intuition about chemistry and interpersonal dynamics is irreplaceable in creating quality entertainment.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing from how you use it now?

User: Currently, no. I feel like we're at a good balance as-is

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you spend more quality time with actors during auditions by handling the time-consuming filtering work upfront.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between efficiency and preserving the human elements that make casting work meaningful will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
