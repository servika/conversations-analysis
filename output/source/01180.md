Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, thank you, you can proceed.

AI: Great, thank you. Let's start with the basics then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a writer, novels and also ghost writing blog articles. A typical project for ghost writing is to get a topic, double check the requirements for both the client and if there's any middle management, do the research, and write the article, typically between 500-2000 words, depending. Research usually takes a few hours, and writing usually takes an additional hour. Novels are significantly more involved, as you can imagine. Each novel is different, but a simplified version of a project overview would be to outline, research, create a first draft, edit, research, rewrite, create a second draft, and repeat until something is ready to be handed over to betas. Those are typically on my own timetable, for however long it takes.

AI: That's really helpful context - I can see how those two types of writing would have very different rhythms and requirements. The ghost writing sounds quite structured with those clear deliverables, while the novel work has that more iterative, open-ended timeline.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Research is the only area I use it heavily, but I will use AI sporadically for another area. For research, AI saves on time significantly by collecting a bunch of sources for me, or helping me hammer out details I either don't understand or have misunderstood. For the other area, I have a writing disability (ironic, I know), and AI helps me when I'm struggling. For example, when I'm struggling with spelling, I'm able to give AI the definition, and it can tell me the word I'm trying to use. Or when I'm trying to find the correct word for something, for example a piece of architecture or an uncommon piece of furniture, when I know what the thing is, but I'm having difficulty communicating it properly. AI is excellent for taking the description and finding the correct words for me.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI is serving two very distinct functions for you. The research efficiency piece makes a lot of sense, and I hadn't thought about how AI could function as that kind of language accessibility tool for writers with disabilities.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Currently, I'm working on a novel that takes place in a fantasy world, but set in a time similar to our Roman era in western civilization. So, research has been key on that, making sure it is as authentic as possible. AI in particularly is helpful in that kind of area because not only can it give me sources that are usually fact checked and reliable, but it is also aware of how I'm applying that research (ie, into a fantasy world), and can make note when something might not be very applicable, or when something might be uniquely relevant to my fictional world. As far as how it feels, it feels less stressful to have that kind of research buddy, and its encouragement always helps me not feel discouraged when the research itself isn't turning over what I might have hoped.

AI: That's really interesting - you're describing AI almost as a collaborative research partner that understands the context of your project, not just a search tool. The fact that it can flag what might or might not work for your specific fantasy setting sounds quite sophisticated.

When you're working with AI in that research capacity, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am definitely driving the creative decisions. The truth is that the writing community is under fire because of AI. There is a 'witch hunt', as it were, on writers using AI. I always make sure I am the creative driver and do all the writing, provable with receipts, because of it. So, I would say the collaboration is forced to be under very strict rules, and there's not much opportunity to explore what it could be because of the atmosphere among publishing and writing today.

AI: That's a really important point you're raising about the current atmosphere in the writing community. It sounds like there's a tension between what might be possible with AI collaboration and what feels safe or acceptable professionally.

Tell me more about that - how has this atmosphere affected your willingness to experiment with AI or explore different ways it might fit into your process?

User: It has affected it greatly. There have many times when I would have liked to tell the AI my entire ideas, just to get encouraging feedback and a hype man, but by and large, if any writer is caught collaborating actual ideas with AI, they are ostracized. Being an indie author is hard enough, and I've known indie writers whose sales have tanked just because they were (wrongly) accused of using AI. Not many readers will double check and just believe the accusations. And most publishing companies now will ban you if you use AI to so much as help you create an outline. So yeah, it has made me greatly hesitant to experiment with AI professional or explore different ways it could help. But it also makes me want to help find a solution.

AI: That paints a really stark picture of the professional risks involved. It sounds like you're navigating between seeing potential value in AI collaboration and the very real consequences of being associated with it in the writing community.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI, even within those constraints you've described?

User: I feel like my writing has becoming more sophisticated, again using AI to help with my disability, and I feel like my stories are more rounded with the aid in research. AI is able to give me significantly more sources than by myself, which helps me improve the worlds I create, and also helps me correct myself when something in my writing is wrong. As far as ghost writing is concerned, by ability to deliver articles is significantly faster, which means I can take on more work occasionally.

AI: That's a compelling picture - it sounds like within the boundaries you're working in, AI has actually enhanced both the quality and efficiency of your work. The research depth for worldbuilding and the accessibility support seem to have had real impacts.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field, beyond the professional risks you've already mentioned?

User: Beyond the professional risks, I do have concerned about AI replacing writers, and the qualities of stories being diminished without that human aspect. However, that, I feel like, is the usual concerns, when something so significant is new and becoming wide spread, and something only time will tell. Otherwise, I have concerns about how writing itself will become affected. For example, I have seen so many people fall victims to this 'witch hunt', even just socially when attempting to makes blog posts, because some people believe the presence of an em dash must mean it was created by AI. They forget, or not realize, that AI has learned to write from humans, and already writers, like myself, have began altering our styles to be starkly different. This will have a consequences in the future linguistically.

AI: That's a really astute observation about the linguistic consequences - the idea that fear of being mistaken for AI is actually changing how humans write. That's quite a feedback loop.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think the current atmosphere will shift, or do you expect to continue working within these same constraints?

User: Something will shift, although I would say it will be more like something will break. The constraints and tensions as they stand now aren't going to be able to last, but what will come out of it will be a solution for everyone. I don't feel confident enough to predict how that will evolve, but I do suspect that AI will become a large part of all creative work, as it will for most all work.

AI: That's a thoughtful way to put it - "something will break" - suggesting the current tensions aren't sustainable long-term.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the current professional climate is constraining experimentation, and that observation about writers already changing their styles to avoid being mistaken for AI - that linguistic ripple effect is fascinating.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of. Thank you! It was a pleasure talking to you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI as both a practical tool and within the current professional constraints will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits you've experienced and the very real challenges facing writers today. Take care!
