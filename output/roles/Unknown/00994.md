Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I primarily use it for organizing my thoughts in designing my start-up. This includes outlining a clear concept, designing pitch decks for different audiences, and honing my brand voice. At the moment, I'm in the stage of designing a teaser landing page with a brand ethos. I've been using AI to hone the correct language, but lately I've found it's not great at good writing, but it nonetheless helps with decision making. When it comes to writing right now, I am the creative and AI helps me organize different points I want to make in an effective manner.

AI: That's really interesting - you've found a specific role for AI as more of an organizational partner rather than the primary creative force. 

Tell me more about what you mean when you say AI helps with decision making in your startup work.

User: When I share my creative ideas or my writing, AI shoots back something, and even if it's not really aligned with what the brand message needs at a particular time, it gives me ideas to keep in mind. For example, if I'm seeking guidance on what language should go where, it might shoot back an idea that doesn't work for the particular micro-project i'm working on at the time, but the idea behind what it gives me could be applied for something else at a later time, or for a different audience. Essentially, the AI provides alternate perspectives for me to consider, and this definitely helps with decisions as it either reinforces my initial creative instincts, or triggers me to explore a different avenue before making a final call.

AI: That's a fascinating way to work with AI - using it almost like a creative sounding board that generates alternative viewpoints, even when those viewpoints don't directly solve your immediate problem.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned that you see yourself as the creative force - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: In the stage I'm at, the things I prefer to do myself are thinking of cultural references or niche concepts that I want to incorporate into my writing. If I ask AI to generate a list of specific references or niches that apply to the topic I'm writing about, it follows a predictable, formatted, and somewhat vapid list. They appear relevant at face value, but as a human I'm much better at thinking of things that really resonate with a specific audience. These are things that AI can't understand, it seems, because these are things that are unsaid, ineffable, part of a collective unconscious in a way.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - you're talking about those cultural undercurrents and unspoken connections that resonate on a deeper level with specific audiences. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate almost 99% of the time. I do delegate completely when it comes to generating an actual document like a deck, a pdf, or insignificant images like logos for small website icons. Things that don't require a particular tone. I will in the future probably hone the design of decks and written documents themselves, but that will come at the stage where I'm ready to emphasize the brand voice through visual design itself.  Right now it's all about verbal communicaton.

AI: So you're very much in a collaborative mode right now, especially around the verbal communication aspects that are so critical at this stage of your startup.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or since you're working on a startup, how has the broader startup ecosystem or community shaped your approach?

User: The feedback I get from the start-up ecosystem and a couple of my coworkers has led to me consider the timing of when I put out content, which changes how I use AI. I was less intentional about the order of content I produced before, but now I'm using AI more intentionally. For example, I began using AI for website concept design more instead of brand voice development. Basically, as the feedback I've gotten has pushed me towards utilizing different capabilities of AI, I'm using AI for help with content infrastructure more than creative writing (at this point).

AI: That's really interesting how external feedback has shifted your focus from creative writing toward content infrastructure. It sounds like you've become more strategic about which AI capabilities to lean into based on what your startup needs most right now.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I am frustrated with AI's ability to walk me through website development. I need a level of clarity and dumbing-down that it can't get right. It's either too simplistic or it's using terms I'm not familiar with.

AI: That's a concrete frustration - it sounds like AI struggles to hit that sweet spot of explanation that matches exactly where you are in your technical knowledge.

On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI made you feel particularly satisfied? What was happening in that moment?

User: I am satisfied with its suggestions for content layout on a landing page. It hit the sweet spot between novelty and simple explanation. What was happening in that moment is that I needed a content layout that hit several key points in a visual flow that matched the brand personality while also considering ease of user experience.

AI: That's a great example of AI hitting that sweet spot you mentioned - balancing novelty with clear explanation while juggling multiple considerations at once.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I definitely consider it. But my only relevant skills at this time are writing, taking a third person perspective, and creative instinct. These are skills that will only get stronger even if AI takes over that role for others, and I probably will never delegate those to AI. I have some skills for graphic design, but I'd actually welcome AI to take that over completely for me if it's able to.

AI: It sounds like you're very clear about which skills define your core value - writing, perspective-taking, and creative instinct - and you see those as areas that will actually strengthen through your work with AI rather than atrophy.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving as your startup grows?

User: right now i imagine a time when I use AI to build different infrastructures (more web pages, coding, and business documents, etc). Once I learn more about what is really involved in my company's getting established, I will certainly use AI to assist with that stuff. I'm at a "I don't know what I don't know" phase, but once I know more I will use AI in all aspects I'm guessing, whether it be only collaboration of full delegation.

AI: That's such an honest and relatable perspective - being in that "I don't know what I don't know" phase but anticipating that AI will become more useful as you gain clarity about what your startup actually needs.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a creative sounding board that generates alternative viewpoints, even when they don't directly solve your immediate problem.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative collaborator while maintaining ownership over the core creative vision, and how external feedback has shaped your approach to AI usage, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Best of luck with your startup - it sounds like you're being very thoughtful about building something authentic to your vision.
