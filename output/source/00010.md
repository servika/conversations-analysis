Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I do not have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I write and run TTRPG games primarily using the D&D 5e system. I do this both professionally and as a hobby. While players of a D&D game play as a single unique character, the gamemaster essentially plays the role of any non-player characters as well as the environment-- reacting to what the player characters say and do. For me, creating an adventure or campaign involves outlining an overarching plot that may have different branching outcomes depending on what route the players take, creating unique NPCs, researching monsters and mechanics, etc.

AI: That's fascinating - being a gamemaster sounds like such a dynamic creative challenge, having to juggle all those different elements and respond in real-time to your players. The branching narrative aspect and character creation must require a lot of creative flexibility.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I mostly utilize AI for any brainstorming throughout the process. Whether this is in the very beginning to get inspiration for a primary conflict/antagonist, asking for unique personality traits I may want to give an NPC that the players will likely interact with, or anything similar. It is very difficult for me to pull creative ideas out of thin air, so a bit of idea prompting using AI is very helpful. A lot of times, I won't even necessarily end up using any of the exact ideas that the AI model gives me, but those ideas were able to spark other ideas from me.

AI: That's a really interesting way to use AI - as a creative catalyst rather than a direct source. It sounds like you're using it almost like a brainstorming partner to get your own creative juices flowing.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Most recently, I was writing a campaign that I would be running for 4 players. I had already worked with the players to help them create their characters and I wanted to find ways to fully integrate those characters into the story. I gave the chatbot an overview of each character and their background and asked for help brainstorming ways to weave that into the main plot or a secondary plotline. I felt very conflicted about it, as usual. I think that AI can be very useful and a wonderful accessibility tool for many, but there are many factors to consider, such as environmental impact and intellectual property.

AI: Thank you for sharing that specific example - I can really picture how you'd want to weave those character backstories into your campaign. And I appreciate your honesty about feeling conflicted.

Tell me more about that conflicted feeling. What goes through your mind when you're in the moment of deciding whether to use AI for something like that brainstorming session?

User: I always want to make sure that I am not sacrificing my creative integrity by asking for something and using it word-for-word. Even if none of the players would care, I enjoy what I do and I would not want to fall into the habit of no longer using my own creativity and instead taking what an algorithm proposes based on a short prompt. I also feel great concern about how the AI model came to generate these ideas. Did someone else create them? Did those people give permission to have their work utilized for AI training purposes? But I feel that I am okay with the line I have drawn for myself, using it to spark inspiration, to avoid unintentionally stealing anyone's ideas and neglecting my creative drive.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to navigate those concerns. It sounds like you've developed some personal boundaries around maintaining your creative agency while still benefiting from the brainstorming aspect.

When you're working with AI in that brainstorming mode, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Again, I put a lot of effort into ensuring that I am still in control of the creative decisions by providing relevant ideas that I've already come up with for context as well as either combining several of the ideas that the AI model provides or using those ideas to spark a different vision.

AI: That sounds like you've really established yourself as the creative director in that relationship - using AI as input but keeping the synthesis and final creative vision firmly in your hands.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: It definitely helps me avoid feeling completely stuck before I even begin because I cannot come up with any ideas. Oftentimes the hardest part of a creative project is starting, so AI helps by providing a solid starting point to build off of.

AI: That's such a relatable challenge - that blank page or empty canvas moment. It sounds like AI has become a way to break through that initial creative block.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of tabletop gaming and creative writing?

User: I hope that people do not end up overutilizing AI instead of utilizing the amazing human creativity that is likely irreplicable. I also worry about AI presenting incorrect information regarding mechanics, rules, etc. for those who utilize it for that aspect of tabletop gaming. I would love an easy way to ask a specific rules-based question, but I do not think that AI is at a level where it is reliable enough to negative having to double-check the answer regardless. \

AI: Those are really important concerns - both the human creativity aspect and the reliability issue with game mechanics. The rules accuracy problem sounds particularly tricky since D&D has so many specific interactions and edge cases.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I hope that I am able to continue to utilize it for brainstorming purposes. Ideally, we would find ways to make it more sustainable in terms of energy usage, which would solve one of the major ethical issues I have with using it more often. I also hope that chatbots are able to improve reliability and potentially be better at providing references to ensure truthfulness and creative credit. If this were to improve, I would love to be able to include AI in more steps of the process like research.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative integrity while using AI as a brainstorming catalyst, and how you've drawn clear boundaries around what feels ethically comfortable for you.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I do not have anything else.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between creative integrity and practical utility, along with your thoughtful approach to the ethical considerations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the concerns - that nuanced perspective is exactly what helps us understand how AI is actually being used in creative fields. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
