Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to find an easy way to explain an insurance term to a client. I also use it for helping write correspondence.

AI: That's really helpful to know. When you're explaining insurance terms to clients, what does that process typically look like? Do you describe the term to AI and ask for simpler explanations, or is there more back-and-forth involved?

User: I usually provide the term and what the insured's question was. If I need more information to fully finish what I'm trying to do there is more back and forth.

AI: That makes sense - so you're giving it the context of what the client is actually asking about, not just the term in isolation. 

When you mentioned using AI for correspondence, what types of letters or communications are you typically writing with its help?

User: Generally it is an email or letter letting the insured know their policy has cancelled or there is no coverage on something.

AI: So you're handling some pretty sensitive communications there - policy cancellations and coverage denials can be difficult conversations to have with clients.

Tell me more about how you approach writing those types of messages with AI's help. Do you give it the key facts and let it draft the full message, or do you work together differently?

User: Usually I provide the key facts.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Probably policy checking. I like to fully see the policy and find the differences between previous and current

AI: That's interesting - so you want to personally review and compare policies rather than having AI do that analysis. What is it about that particular task that makes you prefer to handle it yourself?

User: I'm not sure really. I'm afraid something will get missed and if I didn't do it myself I don't want to get in trouble for missing something.

AI: That's a really understandable concern, especially in insurance where the details can have significant consequences. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I usually collaborate

AI: Can you walk me through what that collaboration typically looks like? When you're working on something like explaining an insurance term or drafting a letter, how does that back-and-forth unfold?

User: The back and forth is generally if I think of something that needs added in or something I forgot about in the details.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: No I really work independently since I work from home and my own schedule

AI: That's helpful context - working independently gives you a lot of freedom in how you approach things. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Finding a way to explain something is satisfying. I've been in insurance for 30years sometimes I use terms that don't get the question answered on the first try.

AI: That's a great point - after 30 years in the industry, you probably have such deep knowledge that you sometimes forget how technical you sound to clients. 

Tell me more about what it's like when AI helps you bridge that gap. What does it feel like when you get that explanation that clicks for the client?

User: It's great because if I know they really understood what I said and weren't just agreeing with me I know they are aware of any potential coverage issues if something ever happens.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: AI replacing workers is always a concern these days. However, in my line of work there are still areas that I believe you still have to have the personal touch to complete.

AI: What are those areas where you feel that personal touch is still essential? What makes those different from the tasks where AI can help effectively?

User: Really knowing your client and there needs. Insurance can be very tailored to the individual person or business and having that long term relationship with them is very important.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I plan to continue using AI to help my daily productivity.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you bridge the communication gap with clients after 30 years in the industry, and your emphasis on the importance of personal relationships in insurance.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate how you walked me through the specific ways you use AI while still maintaining those critical personal relationships with your clients. Have a great rest of your day!
