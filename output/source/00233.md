Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's start!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a software engineer and do a lot of test automation/database management tasks so I will use AI to do numerous things. For test automation, I use it to autocomplete lines of code that I am writing, help me with ideation to come up with new logic on how to write my automated tests, look at the repository to see if there's any files that could help me. For database management tasks, I use it to write complex queries to retrieve the data that I need, making my workflow a lot more efficient.

AI: That sounds like AI is really integrated into your daily workflow. You mentioned using it for autocompletion, ideation, and writing complex queries - that covers quite a range.

When you say it helps with ideation for new logic in your automated tests, what does that process typically look like for you?

User: At times, new logic needs to be created such as new helper methods to retrieve certain data in the database which has numerous links, so I will explain the links to the AI based on the database and it'll create methods to execute queries to retrieve this data, which is then used in the test. Also, I will use it to help me think of ways of hitting numerous test cases in one test, which makes the repository more readable and maintainable, rather than having one test for each test case.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using AI to think through both the technical database relationships and the test strategy itself. It sounds like you're having quite detailed conversations with AI about your database structure and test design.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes there are. I prefer writing the automated tests myself as in the actual tests in the test class that will run as I can easily see the logic and it's a case of just executing the required methods. I don't use AI for this as it would take me more time to understand the flow than if I wrote it myself. This task is different because it is quite simple, and the AI could potentially get it wrong as many methods would be executed and the prompt to get it correct would be very lengthy, so writing it myself actually saves time.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're making strategic decisions about where AI adds value versus where it might actually slow you down. The point about the prompt becoming too lengthy and complex is particularly interesting.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I usually use AI for work when it is a new task, especially ones that are multi-layered. I would give the AI some context to the task and then provide the acceptance criteria so that it knows what I'm trying to achieve. I will then collaborate with the AI throughout the task whilst completing it rather than delegating as I like to have control of what goes in the code as I can understand it a lot better and is easier to debug if any issues arise.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds very deliberate - you're staying in the driver's seat while leveraging AI's capabilities. The way you set context and acceptance criteria upfront is interesting too.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Our workplace is supportive of the use of AI and is encouraged so when we get stuck on certain tasks, we will use AI to think of ideas to try and get through this blocker, such as issues in our code.  Due to this supportive nature, I use AI more as a more positive environment has been created for me to utilise the technology.

AI: It sounds like having that supportive environment really opened up your usage. That's a great example of how workplace culture can enable or constrain AI adoption.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There was one task I was working where my test cleanup methods were not cleaning up the test data correctly at the end of the test run sometimes which was quite frustrating. Using AI, I provided the class that handles the session and the class that contains the test annotations, and I asked how I can ensure that test data is cleaned up no matter what. It provided a robust solution to create a file to keep track of the test data and delete it on the test setup which was very smart. This made me feel very satisfied as it felt like there was nothing wrong with the original cleanup, but this made it even more robust.

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like AI didn't just solve the immediate problem but actually helped you implement a more elegant, robust solution than what you originally had. The idea of creating a tracking file is quite clever.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I haven't had too much thought about maintaining my skills where AI could take over as there will always need to be some form of human intervention if things go wrong, and I would be the person that has those skills. Also, in the context of big codebases, a lot of understanding and background knowledge is required to get the whole picture and AI doesn't necessarily have the whole thing. Not just big codebases, but also company workflows which is developed over the years, which AI might not understand the whole breadth of it.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're recognizing that there are layers of institutional knowledge and contextual understanding that go beyond what AI can grasp. The point about company workflows developed over years is particularly insightful.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: My relationship with AI is going onwards and upwards, as it has helped me to get out of numerous blockers and problems, and I will definitely be continuing to use it. It is going to continue to help me to generate new ideas, new ways of problem solving and expand my knowledge and thinking.

AI: That's wonderful to hear about your positive trajectory with AI. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences - I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you make strategic decisions about when to collaborate versus when to handle tasks yourself, and your point about the importance of institutional knowledge that AI can't fully grasp.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: The last thing for me to mention would be that AI has been a game charger in impoving my workflow and efficiency and I would recommend it to anyone in the tech space to make their work life a lot easier, whether that is coding or even simple things like writing emails.

AI: Thank you so much for that final thought - it really captures the transformative impact AI has had on your work experience. The fact that you'd recommend it broadly speaks volumes about the value you've found in it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your strategic approach to deciding when to collaborate with AI versus handle tasks independently, and your understanding of how institutional knowledge creates natural boundaries for AI's capabilities.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative workflow, the importance of workplace culture, and how AI helps with complex problem-solving will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
