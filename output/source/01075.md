Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds perfect to me! No questions here - I will be sure to let you know if I have any questions as we work through!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: For me, I essentially use AI in two main ways in my typical workday. The first (and most utilized of the three) is for writing redundant code OR what I consider 'basic' code as needed in my work. For example, if I'm tasked with creating some form of a filter and need to be able to easily reverse a list of data in place, a simple task like this can be completed almost instantly with AI - whereas doing it manually would require me to look up built-in methods or functions that are easy to remember from a pseudocode standpoint, but I may be slightly off in some of the syntax - thus needed to research to accomplish these tasks. Outside of that, I also use AI to write more complicated code - especially in cases wherein I am not familiar with the language and / or I have a novice understanding of the language at hand (or some adjacent language). One such example I like to use is that I have a slight understanding of C++ and a slightly stronger understanding of C# - but say I wanted to accomplish something complex in C++ (such as 3D graphics), wherein I know how to do this using C#, but not C++. In cases like these, I would utilize AI to essentially give me a starting template or basic implementation to work off of, and include plenty of detail and documentation (both in the code as comments and outside of it) so that I can get a quick grasp on new concepts individually. This helps me break down complex tasks into smaller parts that are easier to understand and remember for future projects!

AI: That's really helpful - you've laid out a clear progression from simple syntax assistance to more complex learning scenarios. 

Tell me more about that second use case where you're learning a new language or working with something complex like 3D graphics in C++. When AI gives you that starting template with documentation, what happens next in your process?

User: Typically, as specified before, I ask for extensive documentation with the starting template / basic implementation. From there, there tends to be some small errors or slight differences in what I was asking for as an implementation that I quickly fix myself until the basic implementation matches exactly what I wanted. After that, I usually follow-up by asking for more abstract changes to make, wherein they are more focused on the explanation rather than the exact code itself. In the case of our 3D graphics example, let us say we had a basic working implementation of it - something I might follow up with is "How could I go about implementing an adjustable field of view for our example? Could you explain some ways in how I could accomplish this, and provide some brief code snippets as examples? These snippets don't need to fit directly into our code or be exhaustive - but bonus points if you can point me to areas where they could go." - and in this case, I gain a level of control over the implementation process without delegating it entirely to the AI.

AI: That's a fascinating approach - you're essentially using AI as a learning partner rather than just a code generator. You maintain control over the implementation while leveraging AI's explanatory capabilities.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: If I'm able to utilize the AI effectively for the task at hand, there are virtually no tasks where I would explicitly PREFER to handle them on my own, given that from a logical standpoint this would just make my task more difficult if I am hypothetically able to get the same result by leveraging AI instead. Obviously, there are cases where the AI gets completely off track or fails to produce a desired result multiple times, in which case the only option is to handle the task manually and resolve it piece by piece - but these are not "specific" tasks that I actively target without AI, and they are rather just a consequence of circumstance.

AI: That's a really practical perspective - you're essentially optimizing for efficiency rather than having particular attachment to doing certain types of work manually.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: My approach tends to be more focused on collaboration rather than delegation. There are obviously some cases where outright delegation is better (such as writing a simple function or snippet of code that requires knowing syntax perfectly) - but overall I do not typically ask AI to produce me a fully functioning product on its own. Rather, I opt to break the task down into pieces, and have the AI either help with or write entire code snippets, and then fit these into existing code as needed or modify them as needed. Such is the example as I provided with the 3D graphics, where I may ask for a basic implementation, and then follow up by modifying parts on my own or asking for examples on how to continue modifying the implementation.

AI: That collaborative approach really comes through in your examples. You're building incrementally rather than asking for complete solutions.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Most of my collegues I know nowadays have used or actively use AI in some form to aid them in their tasks - and this doesn't have to be explicitly code based. Things like checking over basic emails for improvements, helping with Excel, or in my case with coding - these are all blanket tasks that most individuals I know use AI to help in at least SOME way. Some individuals choose to delegate more to the AI, and some use it more as a basic assistant to only complete very menial or redundant tasks, but in either case, my work (and myself) have both found it to increase our effectiveness in every case. Individuals are not required to do so, and outright reliance is obviously frowned upon given that AI is not always accurate - but collaboration in any degree is encouraged, given that more work can be done in less time and using less resources (as a measure of employee's time) to accomplish the same tasks. I think it has been an extremely positive (and welcome) change, so long as it is being used responsibly and with caution!

AI: It sounds like you're in a really supportive environment where AI use is normalized and encouraged, which is great to hear.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure! Without going into too many details - my job involves working with iPaaS, and in the implementation we use at the job, it essentially runs on JavaScript behind the scenes - but there are pre-packaged "pieces" where you have a bit of control over them (such as creating a variable with a specific name) - but they are designed to be straightforward and easy for people to use who are not well-versed in code. For my position, I instead opt to use raw JavaScript thats gets designated as a "script piece" - so I essentially do not use the prepackaged snippets, but many of the "flows" I work on (as they are called) have a combination of these basic pieces and script pieces. In these cases, they can behave differently from what we would expect - such as having trouble accessing a variable name from a pre-packaged piece in a script, or accessing a script variable in a pre-packaged piece, or any other similar situation. In this way, and because all of these "pieces" are individual and not packaged together, it is hard to keep track of all of the items in any given flow that can interact and cause problems. In this way, I would use AI to essentially keep a running list of all of these pieces and what they do, and the actual code in any of the script pieces to have it all in one place - and this would help me find and resolve errors, especially if they were in some obscure piece and not easy to find. I noticed a clear difference once I started doing this, given that in the past it could take me a day (or multiple days) just to resolve a single error - especially if I was working in a large flow or a large set of flows that are tied together, as changing one thing could cause problems with other items in the flow.

AI: That's a really compelling example - using AI as a kind of external memory and error-tracking system for complex interconnected workflows. The time savings you describe are significant.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not particularly concerned with AI taking over in most aspects of my job. Keeping track of things like syntax or creating the actual code itself is not the difficult part of the job - this aspect is menial to me, and can essentially be done by just about anyone with a basic understanding of coding principles and the willingness to research or look up questions on Google. In this regard, I don't see a downside to AI - it would simply make these types of tasks almost instant and require little effort on the part of the user. The part of the job that I believe is most difficult to replace is the actual creative direction of what needs to be done, and especially in jobs like my own where we are not working directly with code in many cases, as the added "pieces" on iPaaS add an extra element to projects where being a coding expert is not an outright end-all to solve all of the problems that come with the job. I do think about how AI might take over certain roles or tasks entirely at some point, but rather than worrying about it in a sense like it will harm my workflow, I try to think about ways in how it can improve my workflow, and how I can pair those delegations to existing areas or tasks where AI is unlikely to ever become more "autonomous" in that way.

AI: That's a thoughtful way to frame it - focusing on the creative and strategic aspects that require human judgment, especially in your specific iPaaS environment with its unique complexities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As I laid out earlier, I hope to eventually be able to use AI to help me jumpstart tasks quickly by having it provide me with fully functioning examples that work flawlessly out-of-the-box - even for complex prompts, such that I don't have to spend time tweaking small parts that were misinterpreted or resolving errors that come with an attempt at a basic implementation. As I pointed out earlier, this seems to be a big constaint with AI as I currently use it, as in most cases with complex examples there are small errors or minor misinterpretations that still require me to skim or look over the code anyways, but it just saves me time in writing the code as it currently stands. Being able to get these basic implementations quickly and without error would save far more time, and it would help me to hit the ground running with more tasks.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborative learning partner rather than just a task delegator, and how you've found creative solutions like using it as an external memory system for tracking complex iPaaS workflows.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think there is a great deal of potential for AI to improve rapidly in the future - and I think above all else, a focus on it being used in a more collaborative manner will be extremely practical and useful, not just to myself, but to the populace as a whole, should that be accomplished. I think outright reliance is something that should be avoided, so the aim should not be to mindlessly write code for the user without them needing to understand any of it - but to help the user guide the AI to creating a product that fits their vision, while also allowing them to fully understand how it is being done and how they can modify it themselves. I know this may not be a popular opinion, but I think it would be far more beneficial!

AI: That's a really valuable perspective - the emphasis on collaborative understanding rather than black-box delegation. Your point about helping users guide AI while maintaining comprehension of the process is particularly insightful.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative approach to AI, especially in technical work, and your thoughtful take on skill development and future directions will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
