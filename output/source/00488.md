Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm working with Anthropic's research team today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds good! Ask away.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work for an international company. It is content moderation, sometimes its just checking if the content is AI, but other times it is using AI (such as chatbots) to verify information or for me personally, to make sure I didn't miss something in a long video

AI: That's really interesting - you're working with AI in multiple ways. You mentioned using chatbots to verify information and to help you catch things you might have missed in long videos. 

Can you walk me through what that process looks like when you're reviewing a long video? How do you actually work with the AI in that situation?

User: If the content that needs moderation is something like an hour long political video, I can't always accurately moderate and send data back to my company (since the whole purpose is to better the results of search algorithms) I will ask chatbots to either summarize transcripts or ask about current events or even historical claims that are made in videos

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having AI help you process that much content efficiently. 

When you're working through one of these hour-long videos, do you find yourself going back and forth with the chatbot throughout the review, or do you typically gather all the information you need from it first and then make your moderation decisions independently?

User: If I feel confident enough, I will make the decision independently. I also feel like the collaboration between me and the chatbot can lead to better and more confident decisions on my end, for the most part. It saves me time on research, but also cuts out the middle man.

AI: That's a great point about cutting out the middle man. 

I'm curious about that confidence piece you mentioned - are there certain types of content or claims where you feel more comfortable making decisions on your own versus others where you're more likely to collaborate with the chatbot? What makes that difference for you?

User: Well, I have a [REDACTED]. I feel well-versed in several different topics, but stuff such as health topics, or in-depth financial claims are not my expertise. So I am more likely to collab with the chatbot on those kind of topics. For example, if a post on Youtube is claiming all these side effects from a popular medicine is verified by doctors to be harmful, but I can't find something through a simple Google search, that's when i turn to a chatbot

AI: That makes perfect sense - leveraging the AI where it complements your expertise rather than replaces it.

When you do turn to the chatbot for those health or financial topics, how do your colleagues or your workplace culture view that approach? Is using AI tools like this something that's openly discussed or encouraged in your work environment?

User: Yes, it is openly discussed and encouraged. Because we are presented with similar work and there is no definitive pre-requisite to work our moderation job, we all have different areas of expertise. So, we definitely encourage each other to receive help either from each other or from chatbots

AI: That sounds like a really supportive work environment. It's interesting that you have that mix of peer collaboration and AI assistance available.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfied, when I am working on a longer project for work (in-depth tasks typically include moderation of kids topics, since it is more sensitive information and needs to be appropriate for kids) and the chatbot includes perspectives that I didn't originally think of.

Frustrated, when I occasionally see an error in the chatbots response that I believe shouldn't exist. Such as common sense or basic facts that are easily found through a simple Google search. Sometimes that makes me question the validity of using AI to help with work

AI: That's really insightful - especially about how the chatbot can bring perspectives you hadn't considered for sensitive kids' content, but then those basic factual errors can shake your confidence in the whole process.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Absolutely. However, humans and the content they produce is complex. It takes a human to understand a human. Until that isn't true, I don't worry about it.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - "it takes a human to understand a human." 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing much from how you're using it now?

User: I believe it will continue to be the same.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how "it takes a human to understand a human" and how you use AI to complement your expertise rather than replace your judgment, especially in sensitive areas like content moderation for children.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing I can think of!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative tool in content moderation - especially how you balance leveraging AI for areas outside your expertise while maintaining confidence in your own judgment - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
