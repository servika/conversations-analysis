Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I am happy to take part, ask me anything you need to, and I will answer as clearly and honestly as I can

AI: Perfect, thank you for being so open to sharing your experiences.

Let's start with the basics - could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for behaviour interventions for students at secondary school in the UK.  ages 11-16.  I use AI mostly to help me quickly make a targeted reflection sheet, this is better for the students then a one size fits all approach and it means that the reflection can fit the needs of the student.  I do save them so if I need a very similar one again its saved and ready to go but AI is helping me to build a large bank of interventions so I have just the right ones for each student.  I do sometimes use AI to help me make Power Points.  For this I normally ask for information or questions and copy and paste them over.

AI: That sounds like a really thoughtful approach to student support. I'm interested in how you create these targeted reflection sheets - could you walk me through what that process typically looks like when you're working with AI to develop one for a specific student?

User: Firstly as work I do not have memories turned on, I have a separate ChatGPT account for work and home.  I'll open the chat and explain what I need, "Hi, I work in a secondary school in the UK, my role is to give behaviour interventions to students.  I will need reflection sheets for each student targeting why they are in here.  Each sheet will need to have a short, easy to understand description of why there behaviour was inappropriate/dangerous etc.  followed by 8 related reflective questions. I need each sheet to relate to at least one of our CARE Values, cooperation, community, Ambition, achievement, resilience, respect, endeavour and enjoyment. Can you do this for me please?"  The AI responses and then I will tell the AI why the student is here, for example, uniform not meeting expectations by wearing the wrong style trousers. The AI will then give me a paragraph helping explaining why uniform is important and provide me with 8 reflective questions.

AI: That's a very systematic approach. When you get that response from AI with the paragraph and 8 questions, what happens next? Do you typically use what it gives you as-is, or do you find yourself making adjustments to better fit the specific student or situation?

User: No I will copy this into a word document and spend a moment making how I want it.  I will add Name........... Form............... Date......... to the top.  I might take out a question if it feels unnecessary and I will play with the format a little.

AI: So you're taking that AI-generated content and then customizing it further. When you're deciding which questions might feel unnecessary or tweaking the format, what are you drawing on to make those judgments? What guides those decisions for you?

User: If they sound repetitive or too easy. Sometimes I will ask the AI to make 1-2 of the questions multiple choice, if it is too easy I might remove the choices.

AI: That makes sense - you're really tailoring the difficulty and format to match what each student needs. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain parts of this process, or other tasks in your role, that you prefer to handle yourself even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Yes, I need to leave messages to co-worker and parents.  These messages are posted as most staff and the relevant parent can see it, I don't know if you are familiar with Class Charts?   Sometimes I worry that I sound a little repetitive, I am also dyslexic and sometimes I avoid using words that I would like to because spell check cant pick it up.  (Need to put Grammarly on my work PC).  I'm sure AI could help me with this but I don't feel like I should use it.

AI: That's really interesting that you feel you shouldn't use AI for those messages, even though you recognize it could potentially help. What is it about those communications that makes them feel different from the reflection sheets in terms of using AI assistance?

User: Because I want it to be personal.  I work hard with these students to help them and I feel like if parents knew I was using AI to write this notes I would take away from that bit of information they have about there child's day and progress while reflecting.

AI: That connection to the personal relationship really comes through. It sounds like there's something important about those communications being authentically from you. When you use AI for the reflection sheets versus writing those personal messages yourself, do you experience those tasks differently emotionally or mentally?

User: Emotionally they are different.  I have conversations with the students before they fill these sheets out, in these conversations is where they do the bulk of their reflecting and learn to understand why they have been placed with me.  The sheets are almost just like proof that we had the conversation and they have understood.  I also want the sheets to sound a little bit stiff and formal, I don't want them to be so personal that they seam fun or special, it makes the students feel that although I am friendly they are still with me for a reason and its serious.

AI: That's a really nuanced way of thinking about the different purposes these tools serve. So the AI-generated sheets help maintain that formal, serious tone while you save the personal connection for the face-to-face conversations and parent communications. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you approach using AI in your work? Is this something that's openly discussed or more of an individual choice?

User: Yes, when I took on this role my line manager was the one who told me to use AI.  I can have a student come in and need a reflection in a moments notice so I wouldn't have time to write one from scratch each time.  Others staff members have talked about using AI for Power Points and questions.

AI: It sounds like your workplace is quite supportive of AI use. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The only time I was frustrated was when it hasn't loaded a response, but I think that was likely a fault on my end.  In that case I just used my phone and my personal ChatGPT account and emailed myself the response. I am often satisfied with how quickly I can get these sheets made.  But moving forward I will turn memory on as that will save a lot of time.

AI: You mentioned turning memory on to save time in the future. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over more of your work? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am not too worried about that to be honest.  My skills that are most valuable at work are my interpersonal skills.  If AI can start filling out my spread sheets.  By the time the AI starts having those personal interactions with students, being able to tell when more is going on with a student.  Being able to 100% recognise a safe guarding issue.  I'll be retired by that point.  I will keep these interpersonal skills sharp and let AI take on as much of the admin as it likes.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective - focusing on the uniquely human aspects of your role. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Are there other areas where you might start incorporating it, or ways you might deepen how you use it?

User: No not at the moment.  I think I am using it as much as I can at the moment, and I can not see a way that I will use it more unless it can start filling out my spread sheets, if it can copy and paste things from different shared areas onto my spread sheet that would be great. I might get a stock of responses ready from AI for when I just want to leave comments like, "engaged really well with the reflection and work." Just to stop me sounding repetitive.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you maintain that balance between using AI for efficiency while preserving the personal, authentic connections that are central to your role with students.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's great thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you thoughtfully integrate AI into your student support work - especially how you distinguish between tasks where efficiency matters versus where personal connection is essential - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your process and share your thoughtful approach to this work.
