Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: There are two main categories in which I use AI on a daily basis: research and communications.  Occasionally, I will drop an analysis in for validation, but that's definitely not a daily task.

AI: That's helpful - research, communications, and occasional analysis validation. 

Tell me more about what that research work looks like when you're using AI. What kinds of things are you researching?

User: Most of my research is related to the historical financial performance of small businesses - looking for trends, benchmarks, and even accounting policies.  Because most of these companies are not publicly traded, I'm usually hunting for comparables.

AI: Interesting - so you're working with small businesses where public financial data isn't readily available. 

When you're hunting for those comparables, how does AI help you with that process? Walk me through what that typically looks like.

User: It's definitely niche-specific, but most of the time, I'll toss a generic question out geographic information on hiring, economic growth, future city planning, etc. and ask AI to pull up as much information as possible.  I'll typically hit on topics from there that I will research more thoroughly.

AI: So you're using AI as a starting point to cast a wide net - throwing out those broad questions about geographic and economic factors, then using what comes back to identify the areas worth digging deeper into.

When you say you "research more thoroughly" after getting those initial AI results, what does that deeper research process look like for you?

User: Yes, I'm definitely casting a wide net.  Researching more thoroughly can be asking followup questions with the AI or doing my own internet research on a topic.  My own internet research might be browsing company information online, connecting with newspapers.com to find specific articles that my AI doesn't have access to

AI: That's a really interesting workflow - using AI as your initial sweep, then deciding whether to stay within that AI conversation for follow-ups or branch out to your own independent research with specific databases and sources.

How do you decide in the moment whether to ask the AI more follow-up questions versus going off to do that independent research yourself?

User: I just know that I can't always trust the AI to pull out the details I'm looking for without providing it with an extensive set of instructions.  On my end, it's just quicker and easier for me to peruse things on my own.  Since I know what I'm looking for, I can find those threads that I need to pull on

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you know what to look for and can spot those important threads more efficiently than guiding the AI through detailed instructions.

You mentioned communications as the other main category where you use AI daily. What does that look like in your work?

User: If I am about to send out an important email, or I've drafted a proposal, or even writing a social media post, I will drop it into AI for an adit/critique.

AI: So you're using AI as an editor and reviewer for your written communications. 

When you drop that email, proposal, or social media post into AI for critique, what kinds of feedback do you find most valuable? What are you hoping it catches or improves?

User: A wide variety of things!  Sometimes, it's just grammatical errors.  Other times, it night be an assessment of tone.  Other times, I'm hoping the AI will take a more critical review and offer recommendations on key points that I might have missed?  I also might help AI to draft something first so that we can then collaborate on creating a final version.  It's all over the place

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across the entire spectrum of writing support, from basic grammar checking to strategic content review, and sometimes even starting with AI as a drafting partner.

When you collaborate with AI to create that final version, how do you typically work together? Are you going back and forth with revisions, or is there a particular flow that works best for you?

User: That really depends on how the AI responds.  Sometimes I can use its recommendations verbatim, other times I have to go back and forth before I can get a usable output.  I am sure that I am not utilizing AI to its full potential here.

AI: I appreciate your honesty about that back-and-forth process and feeling like you might not be using AI to its full potential - that sounds like a pretty common experience.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I handle most tasks myself.  I would say that I typically use AI as a backup or as a second opinion.  Again, a lot of this has to do with my inability to know how to setup scheduled tasks or use the right type of AI to perform tasks for me.  I am also unwilling to pay for AI tools, so I am hamstrung by whatever free versions I can find.

AI: That's really insightful - so you're primarily using AI as a backup and second opinion rather than as a primary tool, partly due to not knowing how to set up more automated workflows and partly due to sticking with free versions.

When you say you use AI as a "second opinion," can you give me an example of a situation where that second opinion was particularly valuable to you?

User: There are times when I've read something online that is out of my typical expertise.  I find it valuable to drop that info in to AI, tell it what I am thinking or what I think I've learned and will ask AI to help me solidify the concepts for me, just help me make sure I am understanding correctly.

AI: That's a great example - using AI to help you process and validate your understanding when you're working outside your typical expertise. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I do not delegate complete tasks

AI: You don't delegate complete tasks - that's clear. So it sounds like you're always involved throughout the process.

What keeps you from delegating complete tasks to AI? Is it about trust, the nature of your work, or something else?

User: Trust mostly, but my days are not well structured.  I never know what I'm going to have to work on from day to day.  It would be extremely hard to delegate tasks

AI: That makes complete sense - the unpredictability of your daily work combined with trust concerns would make delegation really challenging.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people around you using it similarly, or are you seeing different approaches?

User: I am an independent contractor, so I'm the only decision-maker for how things get done.

AI: Ah, that's a key detail - being an independent contractor definitely gives you complete autonomy over your AI usage.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I get frustrated whenever AI produces an incorrect analysis, or miscalculates a simple summation.  If I am run into a situation where AI does not produce a useful output, I just stop using it

AI: That's understandable - incorrect analysis or miscalculated sums would definitely be frustrating, especially when you're relying on accuracy for your work.

On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI left you feeling particularly satisfied? What made that experience stand out?

User: I've asked AI to research specific topics and the results were more thorough than I was expecting.  I am satisfied when AI uncovers insights that are beyond a basic google search

AI: That's a great example - when AI goes beyond what you could easily find through a basic search and provides those deeper insights.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not at my current job, no.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: My job is likely to be rendered unnecessary by AI, so my career is going to have to evolve before my AI skills evolves within this job

AI: That's a pretty significant perspective - the sense that AI might ultimately replace your current role entirely rather than just augmenting it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your candid perspective on using AI as a backup and second opinion, and how the unpredictable nature of your daily work makes delegation challenging.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your honesty about both the benefits and limitations you've experienced, from the frustrations with incorrect calculations to the satisfaction when AI uncovers deeper insights than a basic search would provide. Your perspective as an independent contractor who uses AI primarily as a validation tool rather than for delegation offers valuable insights into how different work contexts shape AI usage.

Thanks again, and I hope you have a great rest of your day!
