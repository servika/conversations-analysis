Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No that's all good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I pretty much use it exclusively for research, but sometimes I'll ask it to check work that I've done. I work in payroll so it's mostly getting quick summaries of legislation (e.g., how maternity pay is worked out) and then applying that research to my specific scenarios.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI for both research and verification in payroll work. When you say you ask it to check work you've done, what does that process look like? Are you having it review calculations, or something else?

User: I had a staff member query how their maternity pay was worked out. The AI process in this was to use it to research the calculations I should be using. I then did the calculations myself but would check with AI at each indidivual step of the calculations (I never gave it all of the information at once). So my first check would have been: the staff member had a due date of xx/xx/xxxx on their doctor's note, does this make the start of their 'relevant period' for maternity calculations xx/xx/xxxx? The next query could then be 'the staff member earnt £xxxx.xx over their relevant period, does this make their average salary £xxxx.xx, and so forth.

AI: That's a fascinating approach - breaking down the verification into individual steps rather than handing over the entire calculation. What led you to structure it that way? Was that something you decided from the beginning, or did you develop that method over time?

User: I think it's more to do with how my brain works than with what I think of the AI. I just find it simpler to break it down at every step. Although it probably makes me trust the AI more doing it this way as I'm also able to check it's work as it goes while it checks my work.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you've created a kind of mutual verification system. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your payroll work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: To be honest I only really turn to AI when something new turns up. So with the maternity example, I'd applied maternity leave in the relevant payroll system before, but I'd never had to figure out the maths and legislation behind this. So I tend to use AI when it's something new to ensure I've properly wrapped my head around the methodology. So when it comes to the standard day-to-day elements I usually do them myself even though AI could probably help (e.g., tracking hours of staff members at work, figuring out the accrued holiday of zero-hours employees, etc).

AI: So it sounds like AI becomes your go-to when you're venturing into unfamiliar territory, but for the routine work you've mastered, you stick with your own approach. When you do use AI for these new situations, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the entire process, or do you tend to delegate specific pieces for it to handle independently?

User: It's much more delegation than it is collaboration. I'm basically using it as a starting point for my own research, and then I return to it to fact-check my research. If I have follow-up questions after the AI has answered I'll usually use this question as a starting point for my own study, rather than asking the AI for the answer. I think I do this to make sure I've understood and taken on board what the AI is telling me, so that in the future I'll know the answer myself.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as both a launchpad and a checkpoint, but making sure the learning sticks with you. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others around you use it similarly, or differently?

User: I don't think it's used much by my colleagues - I'm the only financial employee in my workplace. It's education based so most of them won't even have access to a phone/tablet/laptop throughout their day. Some of the admin staff may use it but I'm not in the same office as them so I wouldn't know.

AI: That's interesting - so you're kind of operating independently when it comes to AI use. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think when it comes to the bookkeeping side I get quite frustrated. For example, I'd ask the AI the best tag for a certain expense in a specific bookkeeping site, and it wouldn't quite understand the question. I guess the answer is varied, but I'd give it the context of the workplace setting, the item, and the optional tags to choose from (i.e., does it fit better in this or that category) and it would give me an answer about the rules of expenses vs income which isn't useful. It's useful when I ask simple 'how to' questions though. For example, how do I add maternity leave in SAGE, or how do I add an account in Xero, etc.

AI: That's a clear distinction - it sounds like AI works well for you with straightforward "how-to" questions but struggles when you need more nuanced judgment calls about categorization. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yea I consider that. I think long-term I'm considering leaving the type of role I'm in as I'm definitely aware that AI could cover that scope in the near or distant future. I'm aware of the potential to no longer be required with my skillset so in my mind the only option is to widen that skillset now while AI is still developing in this sector. I'm fortunate that I don't work a full work week - I'm not sure how you could achieve this otherwise.

AI: That's a really proactive way of thinking about it - using this transitional period to expand your capabilities. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll continue using it in the same way, or do you see that changing?

User: I don't think I'd widen the way I use it any time soon. I'm very keen to maintain my knowledge and I guess I see over-reliance on AI as a way to diminish what I know? It's useful for efficiency so I may utilise it in that way in the future (e.g., search my emails, respond to this, etc.), but in terms of finance-specific work I don't want to rely on AI and then find that I struggle with concepts or practices I otherwise would have forced myself to learn.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a starting point for research while making sure the learning stays with you, and your strategic thinking about skill development.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for verification while maintaining your own expertise, and your thoughtful approach to skill development in an AI-integrated workplace, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
