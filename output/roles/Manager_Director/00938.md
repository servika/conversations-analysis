Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, thank you!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I work at a university where I have a number of different roles. My main role is as a delivery manager at an innovation unit in the Faculty of Engineering. We engage with industry and academics to create impactful work, like research translation to solve real problems for industry.

Part of my role is business development so I need to come up with project proposals or funding  applications. I use AI sometimes to help me improve the language of those proposals so they are more effective.

AI: That sounds like really varied and impactful work. When you're using AI to improve the language of your proposals and funding applications, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? How do you approach working with AI on those documents?

User: So I will start by writing my own answers to each of the sections/questions in the application, and then upload to an LLM for a review. The review is to make sure I have covered the key points in my answers and to give suggestions for improvement. I also sometimes ask for the language to generally be improved or made clearer.

AI: That's a really structured approach. I'm curious about your decision to write everything yourself first before bringing in AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I find that the AI actually does a poor job in answering questions if I do not give it a head-start with my own work. Of course I need to make sure that the scope and purpose of the project is clear to me and other stakeholders before we start writing. So generally we already have a rough draft of a proposal before AI is able to assist.

I also find that AI edits remove my "voice" from the text. I would prefer the result to sound like me rather than the AI I have used to assist me.

AI: That's really insightful – the idea that AI needs that foundation from you to be effective, and your concern about maintaining your authentic voice. 

Can you tell me more about what it means to you to keep your "voice" in these documents? How do you recognize when that voice has been lost or preserved?

User: It's a very subjective thing--something that  "you know it when you see it". I think that the AI generated text tends to be far more formal than what I would write - even in a business or professional context. So I read it and cannot imagine myself writing like this.

Maybe it is a cultural thing? Maybe as I am not in the USA (can you guess where from?) I am not used to the tone of professional language that AI generates?

AI: That's fascinating – the cultural dimension of AI-generated language is something I hadn't considered. Without trying to guess where you're from, it sounds like there's a mismatch between the professional tone AI defaults to and what feels natural in your context.

When you notice that the AI has made your writing too formal, what do you typically do? Do you try to guide it back toward your preferred tone, or do you handle that adjustment yourself?

User: I try to guide it back to my preferred tone. Usually this is with prompts that state exactly that, such as "try to make it sound more like my original text". Oh one more thing - the AI text is sometimes far too concise and direct, like it prefers to use a very few complex words when a slightly longer and more informal sentence will be better.

AI: That's a really specific observation about how AI handles language – the preference for complex, concise phrasing over more conversational explanations. It sounds like you've developed some strategies for coaching the AI back toward your style.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I have been collaborating with it over a task. I would like to try delegating complete / discrete tasks to an AI but currently I have not set this up. I would like to ensure there is a security / privacy guarantee before I do more of this.

AI: That security and privacy consideration makes a lot of sense, especially given your work with industry partnerships and funding applications. 

Can you tell me more about what kind of complete tasks you're thinking about delegating, and what would need to be in place privacy-wise for you to feel comfortable doing that?

User: Well it would be great to have an automatic review of my proposals and applications, one that self-reflects and iterates on its work until it improves the document.

But as I said earlier there needs to be a starting point that is agreed on. What if it was still collaborative but asked intelligent questions to improve the proposal?

AI: That's a really thoughtful vision – an AI that could both iterate on its own work and engage you in meaningful dialogue about the proposal. The idea of it asking intelligent questions to strengthen your work sounds quite collaborative.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others at the university approaching it similarly, or have you seen different patterns?

User: Well my second role at the university is as a TA teaching first-year engineering. I find that students sometimes use AI to generate their assignments, and it shows that they are not thinking critically about the result as the language is good but their arguments and research are not sound.

I even see this when others work on our collaborative proposals! I won't say who, but a partner we wanted to work with used AI completely to fill out a long application and the results were not good. They missed the point of the questions and even expanded some acronyms incorrectly, a human filling out the application themselves would not make these mistakes.

AI: That's such a telling contrast – seeing both the potential and the pitfalls of AI use in your different roles. Those examples of missed nuance and incorrect expansions really highlight what can go wrong when people don't bring that critical thinking you mentioned.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think I have covered some of this already. As I said, I usually have a draft that I want improved and it is sad when AI "improves" the language but makes it sound unnatural to me.

When I used AI for brainstorming or ideation it often comes up with very "safe" or conventional ideas, it would be good if I were to develop prompts to have it be more innovative.

AI: That's a really important distinction – the difference between language improvement that actually serves your goals versus changes that make things technically "better" but lose something essential in the process.

The brainstorming challenge is interesting too. When you say the AI comes up with "safe" or conventional ideas, how does that compare to the kind of innovative thinking you need for your role in the innovation unit? What would more useful brainstorming look like for you?

User: I mean I think it is not the purpose of ideating right? It is very easy to come up with ideas that everyone else is doing. I think that might be the nature of LLMs if they are producing the most likely responses?

AI: That's a really perceptive observation about LLMs and how their design might inherently push toward the most common patterns. It sounds like there's a tension between what AI naturally does well and what innovation work actually requires.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think (hope!) that I am in a senior enough position in my role that I will be able to use AI as a tool to assist me to become more productive. Ideally it will help my writing and content creation and give me time to think about what is important in my projects.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective – using AI to handle the mechanics so you can focus on the strategic thinking. It sounds like you see AI as potentially freeing up mental space for the higher-level work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you personally?

User: I would like to see an AI I can work with collaboratively through a question interface maybe, or something where I don't need to write so much to put the context into the prompts! Again I would like to be able to make decisions and have the AI understand and execute them.

AI: That vision of a more conversational, context-aware AI that can truly understand and execute your decisions sounds quite different from the current experience of having to carefully craft prompts and provide extensive context each time.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your observations about maintaining your authentic voice and the challenges with AI generating conventional rather than innovative ideas.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's all, thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between AI assistance and maintaining authenticity, the cultural aspects of language, and the challenges of using AI for truly innovative work have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
