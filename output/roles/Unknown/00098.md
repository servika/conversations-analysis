Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use AI for research purposes or as a means of getting a better understanding of how to use a particular technology.  When necessary, I do request references so that I know that I am receiving legitimate information.

AI: That's helpful context. When you say research purposes, could you walk me through what that looks like for you? What kind of research are you typically doing and how does AI help with that process?

User: Specifically, for troubleshooting an issue or to research how to use a technology like JBoss.  For example, one time I had to find a way to add a database module to JBoss.  The AI chatbot was able to provide a helpful example and provided tips on how to properly implement the solution.  In some cases, it hallucinated with providing parameters that don't exist, but I think that's due to lack of understanding of the right parameter that I needed.

AI: That's a really concrete example - thank you. It sounds like you've encountered both the helpful side and some of the limitations. When you mention that it hallucinated parameters that don't exist, how did you handle that situation? What did you do when you realized the information wasn't quite right?

User: I will ask it for references to documentation that could provide the missing parameter.  If that doesn't work, I just revert back to using Google or going to the source where I know I can find the information.  When it works, the AI chatbot does help me reduce my search time when it comes to looking for the information that I need.

AI: That makes sense - you've developed a kind of verification process. You mentioned that when AI works well, it reduces your search time. Can you tell me more about that? What does a typical successful interaction look like compared to when you have to fall back to Google or the original documentation?

User: When I need references, a successful interaction provides the correct url address(es) that takes me directly to the specific information that I am looking for.

AI: I see - so the real value for you is when it can point you directly to the right documentation. That's interesting. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle the implementation tasks, such as creating the script to automate the installation of container images into the cloud platform.  However, I will go to AI to provide a template or a sample script to help me get started, especially if I am new to the technology.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction - using AI as a starting point but keeping the actual implementation work for yourself. What is it about the implementation work that makes you want to handle it personally? What drives that preference?

User: I still don't trust AI to provide the exact script that I need.  I see it as a good way to get started, but not to finish the script.  For example, I wanted to find hidden parameters that are available for use within a devfile.  Since that is such an obscure request, the AI chatbot kept on hallucinating instead of acknowledging it can provide the feedback that I needed.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've learned to work with AI's limitations rather than against them. You mentioned that devfile parameters example where it kept hallucinating instead of just saying it didn't know. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I just started to use AI at work due to internal corporate AI initiatives so I am answering this from a newbie perspective.  First, I don't always use the AI chatbot since sometimes I get requests from other coworkers to assist with important tasks.  Second, I have not solidified a pattern of how I will incorporate AI into my workflow.  However, I mainly use it when I get stuck with a technical challenge such as finding the right solution to a Kubernetes yml syntax error.

AI: That's actually really valuable - the newbie perspective gives us insights into how people are first approaching AI at work. You mentioned that your company has internal AI initiatives that opened this up for you. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: The company is constantly marketing the use of AI internally and have provided educational materials on how to use it effectively.  I have viewed some of the videos and joined an internal slack group, which has been helpful in understanding how to navigate the use of AI and build a career around it.

AI: That sounds like quite a supportive environment for AI adoption. You mentioned building a career around it - that's an interesting phrase. What does that mean to you? How are you thinking about AI in relation to your career development?

User: How to leverage AI to increase productivity, which will increase my marketability to my current employer or another company.

AI: That productivity focus makes a lot of sense. Since you mentioned you're still figuring out how to incorporate AI into your workflow, can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was really satisfied when it showed me a valid example of how to add a database module to JBoss.  The instructions were great even though the example script was a bit verbose.  I know it would have probably taken me about 30 minutes or an hour to figure out how to implement this task.

AI: That's a great example of when it really clicked for you - saving 30 minutes to an hour is significant. It sounds like even though the script was verbose, having that concrete example made all the difference.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am concerned about it taking over most of my skills.  However, I see AI's best trait is data analysis and working on monotonous tasks with significant human oversight.  The core limitation of AI is that it cannot develop new ideas.  It is always being trained on data which implies that the idea must have already existed.  It may come up with derivative ideas, but they are not original ideas in terms of creativity.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - the distinction between data analysis and true creativity. You seem to have identified where you see AI's strengths and limitations pretty clearly.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Especially as you move beyond this newbie phase you mentioned?

User: The analogy I would use is how Iron Man collaborates with Jarvis.  While I might not get to that level of collaboration.  The goal would be to use it as a sounding board to validate my thinking and understanding of the work that I am doing.

AI: That's a vivid analogy - Iron Man and Jarvis as a collaborative partnership where AI serves as an intelligent sounding board. I can see how that would be different from just using it for quick research tasks.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI's limitations with creativity and original ideas, and how you've developed that verification process when AI provides information that might not be accurate.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: The future should be about reducing AI's energy consumption instead of focusing on expanding its capabilities.  The limited energy resources will always limit what AI can do.  That's where I think green energy initiatives can be very beneficial.

AI: That's a really important perspective on the broader environmental considerations of AI development - thinking about sustainability as a fundamental constraint rather than just a nice-to-have. It sounds like you're considering not just the immediate work applications, but the bigger picture of AI's resource requirements.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing verification processes, the Iron Man-Jarvis collaboration model, and especially your thoughts on AI's environmental sustainability will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits you've experienced and the limitations you've encountered as someone just starting to integrate AI into your work.
