Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds fine, please proceed

AI: Great, thank you. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Well I'm a small business owner, I'm responsible for all of the major decisions and sometimes I find it helpful to consult an AI to bounce ideas off. I've discussed sales figures, branding ideas, business purchasing decisions, rules and legislation around hiring staff and menu ideas. It's quite a broad range of topics and I suppose the AI is replacing my need to have a large team of individuals to support the day to day running of the business, especially in areas where I may have an understanding but no particular expertise. Currently I've been using it to help me with an issue I have had with my accounting software, specifically to identify missing and duplicate transactions which are causing the balance to reported incorrectly.

AI: That's a really interesting range of uses - it sounds like AI is functioning almost like a virtual team for you across different business functions. 

Tell me more about that accounting software issue you mentioned. How are you working with AI to identify those missing and duplicate transactions?

User: The problem came about when I realised there was a mismatch in the reported balance and the what my bank statements were telling me. I initially identified that the bank feed had at some point been turned off so there was a gap in the data set that the accounting software was using. After consulting an AI I was given instructions about how to apply the missing data and then the process needed to focus in on any mistakes or duplicates. This involved asking lots of questions about Excel and, as I was directed to use Power Query, all of the various commands and actions involved with that. Furthermore the AI helped with table design and formula writing so that I could sift through the data and discover the issue. So far its going well and I have narrowed the issue down to 3 erroneous entries which I will rectify shortly. Going forward I'll ask for help about how to avoid a repetition and I hope that I'll get guidance about how to automate more of this checking process.

AI: That's a detailed example of working through a complex problem step by step. It sounds like you're collaborating quite closely with the AI throughout this process rather than just asking it to solve the whole thing for you.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Going back to this example I think its important that I can have a firm grasp on the problem and how to fix it. I could potentially delegate things to an AI but then Id be concerned about the reliability - this is my business after all. The other issue is the information I'm sharing is commercially sensitive and so I need to maintain some control and security over it. There's also the issue of knowing exactly what AI is capable of, I understand for example that some can integrate with software such as Google sheets but rather than learning in the midst of a problem about how to do this Id rather work through it this way and learn about that another day.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the need to understand the problem yourself, especially when it's your business on the line, and the security concerns with sensitive data. 

You mentioned not being sure about all of AI's capabilities, like the Google Sheets integration. When you do use AI for work, how do you typically structure those interactions? Do you tend to ask for step-by-step guidance like you did with the accounting issue, or are there times when you give it a complete task to handle on its own?

User: I rarely just set the AI off to do its own thing. Its an area that I don't have a lot of experience with so I suppose I'm just working collaboratively because that's what I'm used to. There are times when an AI will suggest a cause of action, e.g. build a spreadsheet, infographic or logo and I'll accept but usually this comes after some back and forth interactions whilst I define the problem and possible solution. Id definitely be interested in ways that AI could take more of the load off me by training it to complete a task.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like it's working well for you right now. You mentioned being interested in having AI take more of the load by training it to complete tasks.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you're a small business owner, I'm curious if that means you're making these decisions about AI use entirely on your own, or if there are other factors shaping how you approach it.

User: I'm a sole trader so I've no colleagues. My sister has used AI in her work as a university lecturer though. She uploaded mark schemes and gave examples about comments she would use to grade students' work. Potentially this is something that I could do to help with business correspondence or branding and marketing materials.

I also have seen examples online about what others have done whereby they pre train AI to complete tasks which it will do once the required information is uploaded. An example for me might be uploading daily sales figures which the AI would add to a spreadsheet or the accounting software - this would be a time saver.

AI: It sounds like you're seeing possibilities for more automation, both from your sister's example and things you've seen online. The idea of pre-training AI to handle routine tasks like daily sales figures is interesting.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The project I'm working on now with the accounts. Its been very satisfying learning helpful formulas and shortcuts to achieve my goal and Power Query is a powerful tool that I've not used before. But, its also frustrating that the AI assumes, I think, a level of experience that I may not have. So sometimes instructions may have a step missing that a more experienced user would already know. The other frustrating thing is when something hasn't quite worked, the process to find out what has happened is arduous and each solution seems to take me further from the original problem. I think that this could be improved if the AI asked questions to check the progress, eg that I have actually performed the steps correctly and if its not clear go back further in the fault finding process to an earlier step to start over.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the assumptions AI makes regarding user experience level, and how troubleshooting can spiral away from the original problem. The idea of AI checking in on progress and being able to step back to earlier points sounds helpful.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: My business revolves around event catering, preparing and cooking food then interacting with customers and the public. I don't foresee AI taking over in those tasks. But the administrative and creative side of the business is being helped by AI now and I can imagine that at some point it would begin to fulfil more and more of those roles for me. For now I'm mostly enjoying the experience and learning new things. I feel that as I develop my understanding and skills around AI this will be useful in the future. I've already been asked by friends about prompt engineering and how to complete certain tasks using AI. Potentially there is a career in helping others to use AI technolgies.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - recognizing that your core catering skills remain uniquely human while seeing opportunities in the administrative areas. And it sounds like you're already becoming a resource for others learning about AI.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As I said perhaps I could streamline the process so that repetitive tasks are much easier for me. Potentially this would be something I could do on a schedule at the beginning of the week or end of the day. I've also thought about how I could use it to grow the business and take it off in new directions, some sort of check-in about how this is progressing seems like a good idea too.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the collaborative approach you're taking and how you're thinking strategically about where AI can help versus where your human expertise remains essential.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think thats covered everything, its been great chatting with you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working collaboratively with AI, the challenges around assumptions of user expertise, and your thoughtful approach to integrating AI into different aspects of your business will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the satisfying and frustrating aspects of using AI. That kind of honest feedback is exactly what helps us understand the real user experience.

Thanks again, and best of luck with resolving those accounting entries!
