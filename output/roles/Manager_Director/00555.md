Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: great let's do it!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: yeah mostly used in two ways: 1. coding, mainly code completion or to write small pieces of code that I guide the AI with comments in the code and then letting it fill in bits, and refining it (usually github copilot); 2. general smartening up documents using Gemini to refine grammar and also identify areas of improvement

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI in pretty targeted ways for specific parts of your workflow. 

When you're using GitHub Copilot for coding, you mentioned guiding it with comments and then refining what it produces. Can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How much back-and-forth do you usually have with it?

User: it's generally how I'd usually code, so I'd sketch out the algorithm/approach I want to take in a number of comments, break those comments down, then write the code - so AI helps with the code writing part. Usually if I've broken the task down enough there's not much refining to do, but if I keep the scope quite open then I do find I need to correct things or ask for help fixing bugs

AI: That's a really helpful picture of your process. It sounds like the level of breakdown you do upfront really influences how smoothly the AI collaboration goes.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: for coding I usually defer to AI, unless there's something particularly esoteric in the code or something that I want done in the way I want it done. I'm also starting to adopt more AI use outside of coding now the company is comfortable with using for internal work

AI: That's fascinating - you mentioned your company becoming more comfortable with AI for internal work. 

Can you tell me more about what that shift has looked like? How has your workplace culture or your colleagues' attitudes influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: we spent a year saying "AI is bad", despite me being allowed to use copilot. the shift to google including gemini in workspace has encouraged leadership to look again at this, and I played a big part pushing for this too as I've found it useful in my own tests

AI: It sounds like you were somewhat of an early advocate within your organization. That's quite a journey from "AI is bad" to broader acceptance.

You mentioned doing your own tests that convinced you it was useful. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I wrote a whole "who's on holiday per client project" system in a day, together with exportable timelines as PNG or text, purely by using AI prompts - that made me very satisfied, and also solved a business need reducing the need for project managers to export the data themselves and create it. It was also a great example to showcase to the rest of the company how useful AI could be

AI: That's a fantastic example - building a whole system in a day that actually solved a real business problem and saved your project managers time. That must have been quite compelling evidence for leadership.

When you built that holiday tracking system, how did you approach working with the AI? Were you more collaborating with it throughout the entire process, or did you tend to delegate specific pieces for it to handle independently?

User: I already had the holiday information for something else so that was easy, I started asking the AI to expose an API with a subset of that data and tested that the responses made sense, then created a basic front end that fetched the data, before refining it to what I wanted, beyond that I added permissions into it to restrict the data depending on the user. Each step was small and a few times I had to retry but on the whole was good

AI: That's a really clear breakdown - it sounds like you took an iterative approach, building and testing each component step by step rather than asking the AI to create the whole system at once.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I still learn from the code output, things likes map/reduce/filter are different to how I'd code, so the code is nicer. For me coding's always been 'easy', figuring out a good algorithm or process to solve the problem is the harder part, and I will still do that so that I understand the output of AI

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - distinguishing between the algorithm design and the code implementation, and recognizing that you're actually learning new coding patterns from the AI output.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this going for you personally?

User: I think I'll use it more and more, and maybe I might widen the scope of what I ask it to do, i.e. not break down the tasks as much. Also for any pitch decks or public facing materials, AI has polished our outputs so is very useful there. Personally I use it to write larger chunks of code, mainly experimental stuff just to see how I can push AI, and I know that it'll increase how productive I can be outside of work

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you're still learning from the AI's code output and how you distinguish between algorithm design versus implementation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think being able to get companies to trust where their data is going is important - for gemini it claims no data leaves the companies workspace, so we have to take that with trust - with a lot of competition it would be silly for someone to lie, but I still think there's pushback on trusting it, in our case there was, so I suggested we should create our own shared drive in the office and mail server if we really didn't trust google...and they saw my thought process there and realised they were being paranoid

AI: That's a really insightful point about the trust factor and data security concerns. Your suggestion about creating your own infrastructure to highlight the reality of existing trust relationships with tech companies sounds like it was quite effective in reframing the conversation.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from your iterative approach to building that holiday system, to navigating organizational resistance, to the evolving trust dynamics around data security will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

This has been a really valuable conversation - I appreciate you taking the time to walk through your experiences in such detail.
