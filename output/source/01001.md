Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI usually fits into my workday in the context of transcribing content. I am a transcriber and I use AI to create a rough draft transcription of some audio files.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a starting point for your transcription work. 

Tell me more about that process. What does it look like when you're working with those rough draft transcriptions that AI creates?

User: I usually use the AI inside of Microsoft Word to create a transcription and then I will use it as a reference to double-check my work or try to identify any words or phrases I am unclear on.

AI: So you're using the AI transcription more as a reference tool while you do your own transcription work. 

When you're working through an audio file, are you typically transcribing it yourself first and then checking against the AI version, or do you start with the AI draft and then refine it from there?

User: I usually transcribe it first and then check against the AI version. When there is fuzzy audio or the speaker uses a lot of technical/medical terms, then I will start with the AI draft first because it does a better job at understanding technical jargon.

AI: That's a really smart approach - adapting your workflow based on the content type and audio quality. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of transcription work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: AI transcription is far from perfect, so I don't rely on it too much. I usually use it as a backup to check or reference my work. The reasons for this are because the particular AI I use puts periods where there shouldn't be and transcribes every single word which does not align with my job's constraints. With my job, I do not transcribe meaningless utterances like "um" or "uh" so I prefer to transcribe it myself first.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the AI doesn't understand the specific style requirements and conventions of your work. It sounds like your professional judgment about what to include or exclude is really important.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you're more collaborating with it throughout a task rather than delegating complete tasks to it. Is that accurate?

User: I do delegate tasks to it. It creates a long transcript of my audio files and I copy the content to a word document. Then I reference that word document if I am having trouble understanding a word the speaker has spoken. If there is a long block of text (the speaker is speaking for a long time) then I might copy and paste the AI transcript to save time and edit it later. I always edit because AI has trouble distinguishing different speakers.

AI: So you're actually using both approaches - sometimes delegating the full transcription task to save time with those long blocks of text, and other times collaborating with it as a reference tool. And it sounds like speaker identification is one area where your expertise is really essential.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others in your field approach AI transcription tools similarly, or have you developed your own approach?

User: Yes, yes. A human still is better at higher-order tasks such as editing to turn the transcript into a perfectly MLA-style compliant document. I can also better distinguish between the different voices in the audio.

AI: I noticed you mentioned your expertise with those higher-order tasks like formatting and speaker identification. But I'm curious - how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others in your transcription work approach these tools similarly to how you do?

User: I don't know if my colleagues use AI or not. My workplace discourages using AI because they think humans are better, even if it takes longer. I try to use AI only if I need it because my workplace does not encourage the use of AI.

AI: That's a really interesting tension - having access to a tool that could help you, but working in an environment that discourages its use. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I copy and pasted a really good transcript AI created for one of my audio files that had a fast talker who used a lot of pharmaceutical terms. It saved me a lot of time than if I had transcribed the rough draft myself. I felt very satisfied that it saved me hours of work.

AI: That sounds like a perfect example of when AI really shines - handling that combination of fast speech and technical terminology that would be so time-consuming to work through manually.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given that tension between the efficiency you experienced and your workplace's stance on AI use?

User: AI is already taking over a lot of transcription companies. My company prides itself on humans doing the work, so even though work volume is less, it will not be replaced by AI. I have thought about avoiding certain careers where AI will likely take over, like Medical Coding. I have steered myself towards considering other careers that will always need humans.

AI: That's really thoughtful - actively considering which career paths might be more resilient to AI automation. It sounds like you're being quite strategic about your future planning.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think your current approach of selective, careful use will continue, or do you see it changing?

User: Over time, I envision that my use of AI will increase as AI gets better and more sophisticated. I will always edit myself and double check my work. If I leave my current company, I might use AI even more.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed this strategic approach to using AI as a reference tool while maintaining your professional standards, and how you're thinking ahead about career resilience.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI efficiency with professional quality standards, navigating workplace policies around AI use, and thinking strategically about career planning in an AI-influenced landscape will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
