Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No we can begin

AI: Perfect, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for editing emails to students. Some students ask very lengthy questions that require in-depth responses about our processes and ai really helps to highlight important information

AI: That sounds really helpful for managing student communications. When you say AI helps highlight important information in those lengthy student questions - can you walk me through what that process looks like for you?

User: I will usually paste all available information I have on the topic and ask ai to summarize it. I've also used ai previously to clean up master lists

AI: That makes sense - so you're using AI to synthesize information from multiple sources and organize data. Tell me more about these master lists you mentioned cleaning up. What kind of information are they typically containing?

User: these lists contain contact information of agencies. so name of agency, name of contact, email, phone number, address, notes, etc. I like to include specific info regarding the address such as province, city, neighbourhood etc. to further organize the contacts on hand. most of the time I don't have this information and it's faster for ai to find the information online or through the address given

AI: That's a really practical use case - having AI fill in those geographical details and missing contact information. When you're working on tasks like this, do you find yourself checking AI's work afterward, or do you generally trust the information it provides? What's your approach there?

User: I checked it the first few times but it's usually right with the geographical information. sometimes it's not right when I ask it to tell me how far the addresses are to a student's home location -- that I don't usually trust. but other kinds of information such as contact information the ai will give me the most recent or used information found online

AI: Interesting distinction - you've developed trust in AI for certain types of information but remain cautious about others, like distance calculations. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: yeah like I said it usually gets the travel time wrong when asking to compare the distance between an agency and the student's home location, so I check those one by one through google maps. I'm sure ai would be able to do it but it's not accurate so I don't try to anymore

AI: That makes sense - you've learned from experience where AI's limitations are. Beyond those distance calculations though, are there other work tasks where you choose to handle things yourself even when AI might be able to assist? What draws you to keep certain work in your own hands?

User: I've recently asked it to proofread the announcements I'll post on Brightspace for students. but because ai can't really design how I want the announcement to look like (e.g. font size, font colour, italics, etc.) I just format it myself

AI: So you use AI for the content review but keep the formatting and visual design under your control. When you do use AI for work tasks like proofreading or summarizing information, how do you typically work with it? Do you go back and forth with AI throughout the task, or do you more often give it everything at once and let it handle the full task independently?

User: I go back and forth until I like it. it's unlikely I'll just take the first answer

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like it works well for you. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find people around you are using it similarly, or have you picked up different approaches from others?

User: there's one person on my team very clearly using AI, but it's because her English is very poor. she doesn't bother proofreading or editing the AI responses as she sounds very robotic talking to students and staff via email and Teams

AI: That's an interesting observation about how different people approach AI assistance. It sounds like you've noticed a contrast between her approach and yours in terms of editing the AI output.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I mentioned earlier that ai is really useful in editing student communications, as well as filling in the blanks for my master lists (referring to the contact information), but I was frustrated when it was consistently getting the travel distance wrong

AI: Right, so the frustration came from that inconsistent performance with distance calculations. When you think about the satisfaction you get from AI helping with student communications and filling in contact details - what specifically about those interactions feels good to you?

User: I use less brain power and I can focus on other things. these things that I get ai to do can be repetitive and I don't particularly enjoy doing them myself

AI: That's a great way to put it - freeing up mental energy for more engaging work. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it not really concern you?

User: what do you mean

AI: I'm wondering about skills like writing, research, or organizing information - areas where you're now getting AI assistance. Do you ever think about whether you might lose those abilities if you rely on AI too much, or is that not something that crosses your mind?

User: it doesn't cross my mind. I don't think I'd start losing these skills. If I couldn't use ai to do these tasks I'd be fine, but it's still really useful. for example, I wanted to say that ai is also very good at letting me know what the tone of my message is so I don't sound too harsh/mean

AI: That tone-checking feature sounds really valuable for professional communications. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future, or expanding how you work with it?

User: I'm not sure yet, my use for ai hasn't changed much in my day-to-day work. maybe it will if I get another job

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've learned to trust AI for certain tasks like geographical information while staying cautious about others like distance calculations.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's about it when it comes to work-related reasons why I use ai

AI: Perfect. Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you use AI for student communications, organizing contact information, and that collaborative back-and-forth approach you take will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
