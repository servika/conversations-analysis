Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yep sounds good. No questions before we begin

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use AI to help me perform searches. For instance, I'm working on sports stuff, so for particular sports knowledge, I will use AI. In addition, I've been using Google's tools for synthesis of information.

AI: That's interesting - using AI as a search and synthesis tool for sports content. 

When you say you use it for "particular sports knowledge," could you walk me through what that looks like? What specific types of sports information are you typically seeking out?

User: We're designing some cricket software. Cricket has very niche and specific rules, so rather than me performing many searches to understand what the rules relate to, I will just use AI to let me know what the rules are, and how it might be relevant to what I'm working on

AI: That makes a lot of sense - cricket rules can be quite complex and specific. 

Tell me more about how you approach getting that information from AI. When you're working on a particular feature or aspect of the cricket software, how do you typically frame your questions or requests to get the most useful rule information?

User: I just do it like I would a google search. So for instance, can a player return from being retired hurt

AI: So you're treating it like a direct search query. 

When the AI gives you that cricket rule information - like about a player returning from being retired hurt - what do you typically do with that response? Do you use it as-is, or do you find yourself verifying it against other sources?

User: Often I don't verify it against other sources. If the tool gives me references, I might click them so I get a fuller picture than the summarised AI response

AI: That's helpful to understand your verification process - relying on the AI response but diving deeper when references are provided.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your cricket software work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes, anything to do with data and data analysis. I find that AI is not good enough or accurate enough to trust, and I often have to find ways to export that data out of the UI, which has markdown issues when pasting into spreadsheets

AI: That's a really clear distinction - trusting AI for rule queries but not for data work due to accuracy concerns and those practical formatting issues.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it throughout a task, or do you tend to ask a single question and move on with what you get?

User: Usually single question, with follow up questions.

AI: So more of a focused Q&A approach rather than an extended collaborative conversation.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your team has particular attitudes or practices around AI use?

User: I work with software developers, and I know that the are using AI to assist with code generation. Other colleagues use it with their messaging, and it's very offputting as you can tell it's not authentic.

AI: That's a striking contrast - your colleagues using AI for code versus messaging, and you finding the messaging use "offputting" because it feels inauthentic.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Particularly satisfied - I don't know how to code, or to use PowerQuery, so when I asked the AI to create code for me to simply do what I wanted it to do, I found it very effective. Minor finetuning was required, but it ended up saving me a lot of time

AI: That sounds like a really empowering experience - getting functional code despite not knowing how to program yourself.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given how effectively it helped you with that coding task?

User: I don't need to know code, so I'm not particularly worried about that. I also feel that as a business analyst, one of my core skills is elicitation and communication skills - something that AI is not able to do at the moment

AI: That's a confident perspective - seeing your core business analyst skills as distinctly human and not easily replaceable.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or do you think you'll stick with the current pattern of targeted queries for specific information?

User: Heavily dependent on AI's capabilities going forwards. If for instance JIRA's AI tool becomes a lot better (I think it's terrible at the moment), I will rely much more on it to assist with the project management type activities that I don't particularly enjoy doing. Aside from that, I think my current use model is fit for purpose

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your clear distinction between trusting AI for information queries versus data analysis, and how you view your core communication skills as uniquely human.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Google's Notebook LM has been the most groundbreaking thing for me that I've seen recently. It cut down a huge amount of time, and being able to share it with colleagues has been useful

AI: That's a great addition - Notebook LM sounds like it's made a significant impact on your workflow and team collaboration.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you navigate the balance between leveraging AI for efficiency while maintaining your core analytical and communication skills will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Ok. Anything else?

AI: No, that covers everything! We've gotten some really valuable insights from you about how you use AI in your work - from cricket rule queries to code generation to synthesis tools like Notebook LM. 

Thanks again for participating in our research. Have a great rest of your day!
