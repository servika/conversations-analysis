Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: yea that sounds good lets get started

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Right now I'm working as a Frontend Developer in my day job so I usually use AI to help me with several CSS/HTML  concerns I have. I use it to kind of briefly clean up any CSS I have or I'll use it to help me make my CSS more responsive. I also used it to help me set up my react and vite environment

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're using AI for these CSS and HTML tasks, like cleaning up code or making it more responsive, how do you typically work through that process? Do you give it your full code and ask it to revise everything, or is it more of a back-and-forth conversation where you're working through specific pieces together?

User: it could be a combination of both, it usually is more of a back and forth conversation though. I find sending chunks of full code can be helpful when debugging however

AI: That makes sense. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your frontend development work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I would say besides responsiveness and setting up the coding environment i prefer handling everything else. I like to set up my own react components and if i can figure it out on my own i like to write up my own logic as well. I just feel like it helps with learning but at the same time I do learn a lot from using AI as well.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're being pretty intentional about which tasks you keep for yourself versus where you bring in AI help. You mentioned that you feel handling your own React components and logic helps with learning, but you also learn from using AI. Can you tell me more about the difference between those two types of learning for you?

User: yea i would say when i code on my own its more of a memory learning thing? like it really engrains it into my brain so that i won't forget it in future projects. but with AI its more short term that i will hopefully eventually engrain more long term in the future by practicing what i learned from AI, like i might learn a new function or way to write code that i didn't know was possible

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction between memory learning and discovering new approaches. When you do use AI for work, like for those CSS responsiveness tasks or debugging, can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like? Are you more likely to work with it step-by-step through the problem, or do you tend to give it a task and let it handle it independently?

User: typically its step by step since the AI usually doesn't get what i wanted to achieve on the first try and sometimes i even have to figure it out on my own at time. like for example, i'll give it a clamp statement in CSS and ask it to adjust it to be bigger for larger screens for but the same for smaller screens. but sometimes it'll adjust it and the font-size or height of some div will end up bigger for smaller screens along with larger screens so i have to readjust it myself

AI: That example really illustrates the back-and-forth nature of your process. It sounds like you often need to troubleshoot when the AI doesn't quite grasp your specific intent. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk openly about using it, or is it more something you've figured out on your own?

User: oh yea i actually created a website with my friends and its definitely something we openly talk about and I know in the comp sci/software development there is a lot of talk about not using AI when coding in fear that it doesn't let the coder actually learn but i don't really agree i feel like its just generally a helpful tool that helps streamline things when working and if push comes to shove and the AI can't get what i want to achieve then of course i will figure it out on my own

AI: That's a great perspective on the ongoing debate in your field. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: ok well i remember the other day the client im working for wanted a last minute change to the carousel for one page specifically. there is another page with a set of headshots that match the slides in said carousel and he wanted me to make it so that whenever you click on a headshot it'll take you to that person's respective slide in the carousel. prior it would just take you to the first slide of the carousel and i knew this would take a significant of rework in logic for that carousel but with the use of AI i was able to make that initially daunting task much more simple and get it done in about an hour or so

AI: That sounds like a really satisfying experience - turning what could have been hours of rework into something much more manageable. It sounds like AI really came through for you in that time crunch situation.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you're deciding when to use it versus when to code things yourself?

User: not really if i'm being honest i'm not too concerned about AI taking over

AI: That's an interesting perspective. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as you gain more experience, or do you think you'll stick with the approach you have now?

User: maybe it'll evolve as AI gets more advanced and can handle more nuances but right now it'll probably stay the same

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the different types of learning you get from coding yourself versus working with AI, and how you've found that balance between using it as a helpful tool while still maintaining your own skill development.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: not really i think thats about it for now thanks

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you balance AI assistance with hands-on learning, and especially that example of solving the carousel challenge, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
