Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, I don't have any questions yet, but I will let you know if I do!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work on writing research style blogs that have to do with niche topics, sort of a deep dive style! I also work on short form scripts for content! I have other creative tasks such as story or regular script writing that I do as well in my free time.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of creative work - from research-heavy deep dives to short-form content and storytelling. It sounds like you're working across quite a range of formats and styles.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: There are a few occasions, usually when I am looking for new topics to discuss I will use Ai to find those. I want the topics to stay relevant and fresh so I will brainstorm a bit with Ai. I use it as a sounding board for ideas I am unsure about, and need a quick second opinion! I really use Ai for most steps, aside from direct content creation. Mostly as a tool to check ideas, check flow of a passage I wrote, or research

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like you've found AI to be valuable as more of a thinking partner and research assistant rather than for the actual writing itself. You mentioned using it for everything except "direct content creation."

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was researching cults and how the term has shifted meaning from its original use, and how we view it today. It shifted into comparing the tactics of cults to other areas, politics, social media and describing what human trait these all connect with. Ai was useful here to find a wide range of angels to tackle it from, because it's a big topic that can go in multiple directions, and as a way to check what i already had written to see if it had legs, or if there was a more interesting direction to take it. I used Ai to generate outlines to see the flow of potential angles, and for pointing out grammatical errors, or issues with redundancy.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating and complex topic to tackle - the evolution of how we understand cults and their tactics. It's interesting that you used AI to help you see the "wide range of angles" for such a multifaceted subject.

When you're working with AI in that way - having it generate outlines or give you feedback on your writing - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I find that I have to carefully direct the process. I try and make small changes at a time, or ask for a few suggestions before committing to a path to take.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed a deliberate approach to working with AI where you maintain tight control over the direction. You mentioned making "small changes at a time" and asking for suggestions before committing to a path.

Tell me more about that process of carefully directing it. What does that look like in practice?

User: So I find that the Ai attempts to provide suggestions or edits that are often not aligned directly with the direction I want to take. It gets the general idea but some of the nuance can be lost. If a general suggestion is made, I find that either too much is shifted in the process if I am working on a collaborative document, so I stay away from that. I usually start with, 'here is what i have written' or 'here is my idea', and then ask how could this be improve or am I missing something. I tend to challenge the responses to see if they hold water, before moving on to further elaboration or questions.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - it sounds like you've learned through experience that AI can miss the nuance of what you're trying to achieve, so you've developed this strategy of testing its suggestions before moving forward.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: In the past Ai felt more of an entertainment or friendly 'buddy

AI: It sounds like you were starting to describe how AI used to feel more like an entertainment or friendly companion - but you didn't finish that thought. 

Tell me more about that shift. How has your relationship with AI changed from when you first started using it?

User: Sorry, I pressed send too quickly. I was going to say it started as an entertainment or buddy to bounce ideas off of. Early on I would have edits done, but I honestly feel like the editing process has become too unpredictable. This could be due to how much more often I am using though. Either way it shifted from a less serious collaborative partner to an actual asset to the process. I am thinking more strategically about its use. I do feel that for certain features, such as research and suggestions, Ai has become much more useful. The actual editing and creation process feels a bit stiffer for some reason.

AI: That's a really interesting evolution - from casual "buddy" to strategic asset, but with some trade-offs along the way. You mentioned the editing process feeling "stiffer" and more unpredictable now.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: For writing I definitely feel a bit worried about the replacement of talented people. I don't know if i am as worried about Ai replacing the insight and talent, as opposed to being used to flood markets, such as social media with short form content, with Ai generated videos designed to hold attention. I think people tend to take the easier route if it's available, so I imagine more mediocre (no offense) generalized content, as opposed to content that is challenging or pushes the boundaries.

AI: No offense taken at all - that's a really thoughtful distinction you're making. It sounds like you're less worried about AI replacing human insight and creativity, and more concerned about it being used to create a flood of generic content that might crowd out more thoughtful, boundary-pushing work.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I definitely can see the quality shifting to understand the nuances every year. Specifically in comedic areas, I remember when Ai could not understand humor almost at all, but now it can pick it up more effectively. That would be interesting to see Ai be more helpful with comedy. I see it getting even better at collaborating. It seems to get progressively better at understanding humans, so that could be helpful in character based stories, comedy and just curated suggestions that align more closely with what I am attempting to create. Overall, I don't see it replacing the actual content generation, but I will use it much more frequently as a constant writing 'pal' that I can have beside me throughout the creative process.

AI: That's a great way to put it - a "writing pal" that's constantly beside you throughout the process. It sounds like you see the relationship becoming more seamless and nuanced, especially as AI gets better at understanding things like humor and human character motivations.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI might flood markets with mediocre content while still being genuinely useful as a strategic thinking partner for more serious creative work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I'm all set!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative control while strategically leveraging AI as a thinking partner - and your observations about the evolution from "buddy" to strategic asset - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciated how candid you were about both the benefits and concerns around AI in creative fields. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
