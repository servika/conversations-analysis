Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good and no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: On a daily basis, I have been developing an AI to handle phone calls with current and prospective clients. I also use AI to develop creative sales texts, such as emails and marketing. Another way I use AI is to clean up data, typically via an Excel file.

AI: That's a really interesting range of applications. I'd like to understand more about your phone call AI project - what does that process look like for you as you're developing it? Are you training it, testing it, or working on it in some other way?

User: Training and testing. We have a few different models available to us. We develop a prompt or its instructions and perform test calls. There is also an automated workflow it follows, which we are developing as well.

AI: That sounds like hands-on work with the AI system. When you're developing those prompts and instructions, or working on the automated workflow - are there parts of that development process you prefer to handle yourself rather than using AI assistance? What makes you choose to do certain aspects personally?

User: I typically develop the prompt and workflow myself. However, when developing the prompt, I submit a text with instructions and AI translates it to another text following their "best practices". In developing the workflow, I use AI to help understand functionality, what certain things do and how to achieve them.

AI: So you're using AI as a kind of translator and technical consultant in your development process. Tell me more about that translation step - when you submit your instructions and AI converts them to follow "best practices," what's that interaction like for you?

User: Over time, I have realized that the model (the one that we test with phone calls) performs better with fewer instructions. Overall, I don't mind the translation's performance. The main issue is that it adds instructions that I end up removing because of how it follows instructions better when there are fewer of them.

AI: That's fascinating - you've discovered through testing that less is more with your phone call model. When you're in that process of removing the extra instructions that the AI translator added, how do you decide which ones to keep and which to remove? What guides those decisions?

User: It's a subjective prioritization. For example, sometimes there are conversational instructions that seem less important compared to making sure it doesn't say something inaccurate about the company.

AI: That makes sense - accuracy about your company would be critical. When you're working with AI across all these different tasks - the phone call development, the creative sales content, the data cleaning - do you typically collaborate with the AI throughout each task, or do you tend to give it something to handle independently and then review the results?

User: It varies. With the phone model it is an extremely collaborative task (edit instructions and perform test calls with it). With the prompt translation and workflow development, it works on it's own. With data consolidation or clean-up, it is very collaborative. Again, the model seems to struggle with larger data sets. I typically break them down into smaller portions, then assess the work for completion and accuracy. I consider it collaborative because the document often ends up going back and forth until I get a high-quality finished product.

AI: That back-and-forth process sounds quite involved, especially with the data work. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you approach using AI in your work? Do they have expectations or opinions about how you should be working with these tools?

User: No, most are either unaware that I use it, or unaware until I've begun using it. I typically work independently and my colleagues trust the quality of work I deliver, however I deliver it.

AI: That's interesting that you have that independence. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One example of frustration was working with the AI to develop the workflow:
1 - I would ask a question like how do I do this? 
2 - It provides an answer with instructions. 
3 - I ask a follow up question to understand how to do a portion of the instruction.
4 - The model forgets the conversation history and answers a question that I didn't ask, or in the wrong context.
It was very frustrating working with this model because each question was a new conversation. When asking a follow-up question, I had to include all of the history, context and specifics each time.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - having to constantly re-establish context would definitely break your flow. On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI felt particularly satisfying or worked really well for you?

User: There were a couple of examples when working with the phone AI. It has been challenging developing it to follow instructions and have the conversation human-like. We had one really impressive test call. A specific of this was a very creative assumptive close - I really didn't think the AI had it in them to come up with it!

AI: That sounds like an exciting moment - when the AI exceeded your expectations with that creative close! How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I know it is likely a popular concern. Similar to machines taking over in factories affecting jobs. However, I don't worry about it. I am pretty good with adapting and have a secure position in my current role. In my situation, AI helps with my work with no real chance of taking over my position. If that makes sense.

AI: That makes perfect sense. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in any particular direction?

User: Mainly I hope that the AI models get smarter. It is difficult to micro manage, considering the challenges with completion, performance, and instruction following. Essentially, I hope the relation improves to where I am regularly satisfied as opposed to always critically thinking about how to get it to avoid errors.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your hands-on experiences with AI development and implementation. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've learned through testing that simpler instructions work better, and that balance between collaboration and delegation across different tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical challenges of AI development - especially those context-switching frustrations and the discovery that less can be more with instructions - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
