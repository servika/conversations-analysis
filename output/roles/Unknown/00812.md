Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

To get us started, could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to help me brainstorm story ideas or to research specific parts needed for my fiction writing.

AI: That's really interesting - fiction writing is such a creative field. When you say you use AI for brainstorming story ideas, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: I would start by asking "help me brainstorm 5 ideas for a cozy romance fiction featuring two women and a gay best friend" and then from the answers, I either pick 2 favorites to flesh out more with the AI help or have it give me a new set

AI: That's a fascinating approach to the creative process. When you're fleshing out those favorite ideas with AI help, what does that collaboration look like? Are you bouncing ideas back and forth, or do you tend to take the initial concept and develop it mostly on your own?

User: I usually go about 3 levels deep with the AI. so we get the basic idea together, then refine it, have it suggest characters and an overall plot arc. Mostly it's using the AI to bounce ideas off and refine the details

AI: That sounds like a really iterative process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI on your writing. Are there certain aspects of the creative process you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those parts feel different to you?

User: I do not use the AI to do any of the actual writing. I use the AI almost as a white board to talk out ideas, get options, but i would never use the AI to do any of the actual writing for me. I dont think that's what writing is all about.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you make between ideation and the actual writing itself. What is it about the writing process that feels important for you to maintain control over? What does writing mean to you that makes you want to keep that part entirely your own?

User: Fiction writing is about letting others see the idea/story/scenes in my imagination. I cant let the AI do that for me, as it has no access to my dreams/imagination. And I wouldn't let it write an idea for me as it has no imagination.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you see the writing itself as this very personal act of translating your inner vision into words. When you're in those brainstorming sessions with AI, going through those three levels of refinement, how does it feel to work that way? Can you describe what that collaboration experience is like for you emotionally?

User: Emotionally, I suppose it's like making a bunch of notes on stickynotes and then showing a friend for their opinion.

AI: That's a great analogy. So it sounds like you experience it as a fairly comfortable, low-stakes kind of interaction - like running ideas past someone you trust. I'm curious about the research side of your AI use that you mentioned at the beginning. How does that part of your process work, and does it feel similar or different from the brainstorming sessions?

User: If i'm doing research, I more ask direct questions such as "tell me about Russia in the 1990s brief overview". it's not collaberative, it's more of a summary from web searches i'm interested in.

AI: So that research mode sounds much more transactional - you ask a specific question and get information back. When you compare those two different ways you use AI - the collaborative brainstorming versus the direct research requests - do you find yourself preferring one approach over the other, or do they each serve their purpose well?

User: They each serve their purpose well. I don't think one is better than the other

AI: That makes sense - different tools for different jobs. I'm curious about how your work environment or colleagues have influenced the way you use AI in your writing. Have other writers you know shaped your approach, or is this something you've developed pretty independently?

User: I developed it on my own. Most of my fellow writers are very anti-AI in all aspects of writing, but I see AI as a different search interface, so as long as I'm not giving it any sort of control over my finished product, I dont see a problem with using it for research and soundboarding

AI: That's really thoughtful - you've carved out your own approach despite being in a community that's largely opposed to AI use. It sounds like you have a pretty clear philosophical framework around what feels acceptable versus not. Can you share a time when using AI for your writing work made you feel particularly satisfied or maybe frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Recently, I used it to help me decide on a catageory to focus my next novel on. I gave it 3 options and we talked it out and I had it mock up some plot/descriptions to help me decide. it was very helpful

AI: That sounds like a really productive session. What specifically made that experience feel so helpful to you? Was it the ability to quickly see different directions fleshed out, or something else about how that conversation unfolded?

User: Its easy to express myself in clipped words and the AI seems to understand what I mean which is helpful when I can't articulate. It's also nice to see everything laid out so I can choose

AI: That's really insightful - the AI helping you when you can't quite find the words, and then organizing everything visually so you can make better decisions. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI in your writing work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or do you think you've found your comfortable approach?

User: I think i'm comfortable with this. I may try to use the AI as a 'beta reader' and see if there is good constructive critism from it.

AI: That's an interesting potential evolution - using it as a beta reader. Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that clear boundary between ideation and the actual creative expression, and how you've developed your own approach despite being in a community that's generally opposed to AI use.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your writing work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative brainstorming partner while maintaining creative control over the actual writing will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate how thoughtful you were about articulating the distinctions in how you approach different aspects of your creative process.
