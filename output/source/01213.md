Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: So I'm studying Software Development which is what I use AI to assist with. As such, I haven't done any specific "research projects" just yet, but I have used AI to assist with small projects in order to test and improve my coding skills.
One of these was designing and implementing the game "twenty one" in Python. I began by breaking the problem down into steps: initialising the deck, dealing, player's turn, dealer's (computer's) turn and management winning/losing conditions. 
I didn't use AI until I had a version of the game that I could use/test - the purpose of AI was to spot bugs (e.g. edge cases) and point them out to me so I could further investigate and fix. 
I also used it to provide suggestions for refinement and/or refactoring - perhaps improving the logic, or minimising repetition of code. 
An example of this was refactoring a conditional: I had two `if` statements but the conditions were mutually exclusive, so the use of an `elif` would have made it clearer.
Once I had a working game, I iterated over changes with the help of AI to refine it and add extra features (such as making it a "best of 5" game, and improving input handling for messages to the user like `Play again?` )

AI: That's a really helpful example - I can see how you approached it systematically. Tell me more about that decision point where you had a working version and then chose to bring AI into the process. What made you decide to use AI for debugging and refactoring versus continuing with your traditional approach?

User: I decided to use AI once I had a working version of the game. That is, I could run the program and play a single round of the game (I did this several times as I didn't have a "play again?" option at the time) and the correct winner was displayed (along with the correct cards of the player and the dealer). Even though it worked, I knew it was as efficient as it could be and was missing some useful features.
I wanted to actual spend my limited time debugging, as opposed to looking for bugs to debug. I therefore used AI to point out potential bugs and spent my time addressing them. The refactoring wasn't a primary concern when I decided to bring in the AI, but it pointed out opportunities for doing so regardless - this was useful as it made me rethink some of my logic

AI: That's really insightful - you wanted to focus your time on actually fixing issues rather than hunting for them. When the AI pointed out those potential bugs and refactoring opportunities, how did you go about verifying or validating what it suggested before implementing the changes?

User: I used VSCode for the process, so when a potential bug was highlighted, I was able to test and examine it easily. I made use of a REPL (via terminal, rather than within VSCode) to test small snippets of code, and I also had a separate 'test.py' file open which I regularly used to copy and paste large chunks of code, or functions, into so I could test them in isolation. 
For major refactoring suggestions, I used git to create branches (AI was also very useful here to remind me how to do it). Once I was happy with the new functionality of the code, I merged the branches and retested the code).

AI: That's a really thorough verification process you developed. I'm curious - thinking about the parts of your coding work where you haven't used AI, what's kept you from trying it there?

User: The course I am doing is very thorough. Some of the smaller projects (or smaller chunks or larger projects), have suggested solutions which are only visible once you want to see them. For the most part, once I had attempted my own solution, I am able to compare with their suggestions and troubleshoot/modify as necessary. Very rarely would I come across such a difference between my solution and the courses that it would require AI to help me understand and solve. I suppose I trust the courses solution enough that I don't feel the need to explore it with AI.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you have that trusted educational resource built into your learning process. We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your coding or software development work that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I think the process of preparing for assessments would benefit from AI assistance. The course is split into sections and each has an assessment - the content for that assessment is provided, but it can be quite hard to find where that content is contained within that part of the course. The course draws from multiple sources so if the assessment study guide states that topic 'x' needs to be learnt, it can sometimes take a while to find all parts of the course that relate to topic 'x'. 
If AI could create a study guide with links, or that just brings all the relevant content into one place, it would save time scanning back through the part of the course to find it.

AI: That's a really practical need - consolidating scattered content from multiple sources into a coherent study guide. It sounds like AI could be particularly valuable for that kind of information organization and synthesis task.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on using AI as a focused debugging and verification tool, while maintaining that systematic approach to learning, was particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your software development work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically - waiting until you had a working foundation and then leveraging it for targeted debugging rather than initial development - really help us understand how thoughtful developers approach AI integration. The way you've built such thorough verification processes around AI suggestions also shows a mature approach to working with these tools.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!
