Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, lets begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI to craft story ideas and then write the stories. This is for a youtube account I run where I read aloud these stories as bedtime stories for adults. Initially I like to use the chatbot to come up with story ideas which fit within the remit of my channel (for adults, soft, calm, gentle, soothing, etc). Once I get an idea I like, I ask the chatbot to write a plan for the story in 4 parts. This is important as most chatbots I have used can only write up to 1000 words reliably, and I need the stories to be about 4000 words to be the correct length. Once I have the plan, I ask the chatbot to write each section in turn with a word count suggestion of 1000 words. I do then have to do some editing to make sure they flow together like a story.

AI: That's a fascinating creative workflow you've developed. It sounds like you've really thought through how to work around the limitations of AI tools to get what you need.

When you mention doing editing to make the sections flow together - what does that process typically look like for you? Are you doing light touch-ups, or more substantial rewriting to connect the pieces?

User: It is mainly light touch ups. I tend to have to remove closing statements from the end of the stories, and then rewrite this to flow into the next section. With the middle sections I have to also sometimes rewrite the initial paragraph, again so it doesn't read like the beginning of a whole new story. As such I probably have to tweak or rewrite about 6 paragraphs or sentences.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're essentially acting as the editor to smooth out those seams between sections. 

I'm curious about the story idea generation part of your process. When you're brainstorming with AI for those initial concepts, how much back-and-forth do you typically have? Are you usually happy with the first batch of ideas it gives you, or do you find yourself going several rounds to get something that feels right for your channel?

User: Normally the initial round will provide at least one idea I like. I typically ask for 10 story suggestions, and give a basic remit for the type of stories I want. I try to be thorough to ensure I'm getting the right kind of ideas the first time round. Sometimes I might have to continue the conversation to add slight changes to some of the story ideas, but normally the conversation is only 1 or 2 rounds long for this part of the process.

AI: That sounds like you've really dialed in your prompting approach to get what you need efficiently. 

I'm interested in your creative process here - are there aspects of creating these bedtime stories that you prefer to keep for yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? Things you feel are important for you to handle personally?

User: There is nothing that I like to handle completely, but I do like working collaboratively with the AI chatbot to formulate the story line. I do find that sometimes the story ideas given start well, but the endings can sometimes not be quite suitable. So I guess the ending of the stories, how they conclude, are one element I really like to guide the most.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like the story conclusions are where your creative judgment becomes most critical. 

When you say the endings aren't quite suitable, what tends to go wrong with them? Are they too abrupt, or maybe not matching the gentle, soothing tone you're aiming for?

User: They do tend to end quite abruptly. A good ending needs a satisfying conclusion, and for the particular types of stories I am interested in they need to be happy, uplifting, or have a positive moral story to them.

AI: That makes perfect sense for bedtime stories - you want people to drift off feeling peaceful and positive, not with something that feels unfinished.

When you're working with AI throughout this whole process - from brainstorming to writing the sections - how would you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more collaborating back and forth throughout each step, or do you tend to give it a task and let it run with it before you step back in?

User: I like to be as thorough as possible with my initial prompts, see what the chatbot provides, then tweak from there. For example, I had my own story idea, but for one section the chatbot repeated information which contradicted information in the previous section. I forgot to mention this in my prompt and so had to continue the conversation to remind the chatbot not to include certain things. But yes, I like to see what the chatbot can do, then tweak.

AI: That's a great example of how those little details can trip up the process. It sounds like you've developed a good sense of when to step in and course-correct.

How have your audience or the YouTube community influenced the way you use AI in creating your content? Do you find yourself thinking about how your viewers might react to AI-generated stories, or has that affected your approach at all?

User: I do worry about the community being concerned about the use of AI when writing these stories, and it is not something I advertise. If asked, I will confirm the use of AI, but otherwise I don't mention it. I do know that within creative communities (artists, writers, etc) that there is concern about AI stealing jobs, but as a new creator with limited income, I cannot afford to hire writers, although this is something I hope to do in the future if the channel becomes more profitable.

AI: That's a really honest perspective, and it sounds like you're navigating some complex feelings around this. The economic reality of starting a creative venture while being mindful of the broader creative community's concerns.

Can you share a time when using AI for your stories made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: With regards to a particularly satisfying experience, I would say the first time I used AI to complete the whole process. From idea generation, to writing a storyline, to actually writing the final sections. It surprised me how easy the process can actually be. I consider myself a highly creative person, I have the story ideas aswell, but I do struggle with the writing process. Particularly when it comes to writing in a certain style (for the adult bedtime listening audience in this case). With regards to a frustrating experience, I initially tried asking the chatbots to write the full 4000 word story, and they just couldn't get anywhere close. All of the stories were approximately 1000 words, so nowhere near how long I needed them to be. This actually guided my process of splitting the story into 4 sections of approximately 1000 words as it was so annoying not being able to get anything like what I wanted on the first try.

AI: That's such a perfect example of how limitations can actually lead to better solutions. Your frustration with the length issue essentially forced you to develop a much more structured and reliable process.

It sounds like AI has become a real enabler for you - helping you get your creative ideas into a form that works for your audience, even when the actual writing part was challenging for you personally.

How do you think about maintaining or developing your own writing skills in areas where AI is helping you so much? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It isn't something I actively consider. Writing is something I have really enjoyed since being a child, so I understand my own limitations pretty well by this point. I know I cannot write well enough to make a cohesive and engaging story. I just can't do it. At present it is not something I want to focus on either, as my career path currently means I run several different projects at a time to earn a living. I just don't have the time or focus to be able to do it alone.

AI: That's a really clear-eyed assessment of where you are right now and what your priorities need to be. It sounds like AI is allowing you to express your creativity in a way that fits your current life situation and constraints.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI evolving as your YouTube channel grows or your circumstances change?

User: I hope that my understanding of how AI works will grow and so I can start writing better prompts to be able to get the final outcome I need even quicker. The faster the story writing process is, the more I can focus on the other aspects of my YouTube account, like video editing, marketing, etc. I do eventually foresee no longer using AI to write my stories, but this will only be if the channel becomes profitable enough for me to use human writers.

AI: That's a really thoughtful progression you've mapped out - from optimizing your AI workflow now to potentially transitioning to human writers when the economics make sense.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about using AI as a creative tool while balancing practical constraints and community concerns. I particularly appreciated how you turned that initial frustration with story length into a systematic approach that actually works better.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, thank you for the interview :)

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about developing creative workflows with AI, navigating community perceptions, and balancing practical constraints with long-term goals will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction.

It's been really fascinating to hear how you've turned AI into such an effective creative partner for your specific needs. Best of luck with your YouTube channel!
