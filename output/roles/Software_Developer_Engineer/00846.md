Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Everything good. No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I especially use it for coding, but also to understand new topics and also for researching on different subjects

AI: That's helpful - coding, learning new topics, and research. Can you walk me through what a typical coding session with AI looks like for you? How do you actually work together on code?

User: I used to use cursor(and sometimes I still use it), but normally i use chatGpt app to work allong with my projects in visual studio code. That means that if i have a question about some parts of the code i'll ask the ai and if i'm interested about creating new features or potential improvements i'll also ask the ai.

AI: Interesting - so you're moving between your code editor and ChatGPT to get help with specific questions and ideas for new features. 

When you're working on these coding tasks, do you find yourself asking the AI to write entire functions or components for you, or are you more likely to discuss the approach with it and then write the code yourself?

User: Usually I'm asking about approaches to find the best one that fits my project, thenI'll guid the ai to build functions, components based on a specific plan that I chose before

AI: That's a really clear workflow - you evaluate approaches first, make the decision, then guide the AI through implementation based on your chosen plan.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain coding tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to hand over to the AI everything that it can do, and I prefer to be more focused on the harder parts or on the simple tasks that the AI often misses

AI: That's fascinating - you're essentially dividing the work by complexity, handling both the hardest parts and the simple tasks that AI tends to miss, while letting it take care of everything in between.

Can you give me an example of what you mean by "simple tasks that the AI often misses"? What are some of those tasks that seem straightforward but AI doesn't handle well?

User: Usually on large codebases when I provide the AI with a file, it often creates mentions to other files or functions outside the specified file that in my code exist in other forms, so I edit the code based on that. Sometimes the AI creates functionalities that already exist in my codebase so I'll refactor the code to use those. Also there are moments when I provides a structure for the files that does not match with my structure so I'll use the code but I'll adapt it for my codebase

AI: Ah, that makes perfect sense - the AI lacks the full context of your entire codebase, so it makes assumptions about imports, function names, or creates duplicate functionality instead of using what you already have. You're essentially doing the integration work to make the AI's code fit properly into your existing system.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Usually, I'm collaborating. I'll start by providing the context of the app and what I already did, then I'll i explain what i need to do - a new feature, a function and so on. Then I'll ask about possible solutions that could work. Then I'll ask the ai to do it - sometimes a bigger task, sometimes a big task but in small steps based on a specific plan: mine or a plan created in collaboration with the AI

AI: That's a very collaborative approach - you're essentially working as partners through the whole process, from initial context setting to exploring solutions together, and then either tackling it as one big task or breaking it down strategically.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has their attitude toward AI shaped how you approach using it?

User: Actually, I'm the one who influenced them to use the AI.

AI: That's interesting - you're the AI advocate in your workplace! 

Can you tell me more about that experience? What convinced you to start using AI in the first place, and what was it like introducing your colleagues to it?

User: I heard a lot of stuff about the AI and that it can also write tools so i started to use a free version to try its capabilities. Firstly I used it on small tasks or where I was getting stuck, then I started to use it more and more. The help that the AI gave me made me to talk with my colleagues about it and they also started to use it(some of them at least)

AI: That progression makes sense - starting small when you got stuck, then gradually expanding as you saw the benefits, and naturally sharing that experience with your team.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I remember one time when i was looking for a bug and I didn't know how to fix it. I was looking on different webistes with no results. Also I was asking the AI about it and it provided different solutions that were not helping. By the way, always I get frustrated when I ask the AI for debugging and it provides solutions that are not working for me and if I say that these are not working for me the AI will try other slightly different approaches and eventually, if those are not working, the AI will return to the initial provided solutions and will provide the same solutions even if i tell it that they not work

AI: That debugging frustration sounds really relatable - getting caught in that loop where the AI keeps cycling back to solutions you've already told it don't work. That must be maddening when you're stuck on a bug and need actual help.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm think about improving my skills and "attack" the AI. What I mean is that I'm improving my skills on the AI side, how the AI works, how can i use it and so on, so if the AI is going to do my actual tasks I'm going to learn how to use the AI in ways that few people know

AI: That's a really strategic mindset - instead of competing against AI, you're positioning yourself to become an expert in AI utilization itself. You're essentially future-proofing by becoming the person who knows how to get the most out of these tools.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As the AI evolves, I'm going to use it more to improve my productivity.

AI: That's a clear vision - riding the wave of AI improvements to boost your own productivity.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on becoming an AI expert rather than competing with it, and your detailed explanation of how you handle the integration challenges when AI doesn't quite understand your codebase context.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative workflow you've developed, the challenges with debugging loops, and your strategic approach to becoming an AI utilization expert will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable hearing your perspective. Have a great rest of your day!

User: thank you

AI: You're very welcome! Take care!
