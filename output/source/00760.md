Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to help me do monotonous tasks (like alphabetizing), brainstorming ideas (especially when I need multiple ideas and am running out of steam), and to help me make sure I cover all my bases / include all the information I otherwise would have forgotten to include.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of uses. When you mention using AI to make sure you cover all your bases and include information you might have forgotten - can you tell me more about that? What does that process typically look like for you?

User: Yeah. I tutor as my day job. A lot of time (especially when I am developing projects and lessons), I want to make sure that I'm not missing any key information. For example, I might ask for a sample rubric for a project to compare to one I have developed and see what additions the AI included that I may not have thought to include. I do a similar process when lesson planning.

AI: That's a smart approach - using AI as a kind of quality check against your own expertise. When you get that sample rubric back from AI and compare it to yours, what typically happens next? Do you find yourself adopting the AI's suggestions, or does it more often just confirm you're already on the right track?

User: A bit of both. I would say that most of the time (~70%), there's nothing to add / I had already gotten everything / any "additions" that the AI had, I ultimately deemed unnecessary, but sometimes the AI's version of the rubric, etc. has something in it that I hadn't thought to include and is actually quite helpful so I end up adopting it for my own version. Even though the majority of the time there isn't anything, I find that the times there is something make it worth checking nonetheless.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - even if it's only useful 30% of the time, catching those gaps seems valuable. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your tutoring work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Definitely. I really enjoy creativity-based work, so I usually do a lot of that myself (writing up scenarios, designing classroom games, etc.). I do frequently use AI for brainstorming, though- especially if I am faced with a scenario where I need multiple examples of something and can't seem to come up with enough ideas on my own.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you really value the creative process itself, not just the end result. When you do turn to AI for brainstorming those multiple examples, how does that interaction typically unfold? Are you working back and forth with the AI to develop ideas together, or asking it to generate a list that you then pick from?

User: For example, I might be developing a list of project ideas for students to choose from based on one learning topic. I may be able to come up with 3 relevant project ideas myself, but I might struggle to come up with any more that fit the necessary criteria. Although AI usually gives me a lot of ideas too similar to onesin these scenarios, there's typically at least o I already have ne or two good ideas that come out of the situation. As such, for brainstorming specifically I generally prefer a list to pick from but sometimes it requires a little bit of back and forth for the AI to understand exactly what I'm looking for.

AI: That back-and-forth to help the AI understand what you're looking for - that sounds like it requires some skill on your part to guide it in the right direction. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself discussing these approaches with other tutors or educators?

User: Not really. As far as lesson materials go, there have always been online resources that teachers share back and forth, so AI has just kind of fallen into place in that system as another resource for teachers to pull from when creating lessons, projects, etc. It's definitely a necessary evolution for teachers - lesson planning would be nearly impossible time-wise without having pre-built support via technology and other teachers.

AI: That's really insightful - you're describing AI as naturally fitting into an existing ecosystem of shared resources rather than being something completely revolutionary. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There was one time when I was trying to get the AI to help me with some monotonous tasks, where I needed a list of students and relevant information organized in a very specific format. At the end of a long back and forth, I ended up with a response that didn't even meet all my criteria and the feeling that, despite being a long job (something that would have taken me a long time to do on my own), I should have just done it myself. I can definitely appreciate the evolution AI has provided for the world of monotonous tasks, but I think that currently (and especially for tasks that require precision to be actually helpful / where a partially correct response is basically unhelpful) AI's definitely excels in the creativity and brainstorming department, but can lead to a lot of frustration in the (detailed) formatting department.

AI: That frustration really comes through - it sounds like you ended up doing more work trying to get the AI to understand your specific requirements than if you'd just tackled it yourself from the start. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your work as a tutor?

User: Could you clarify what you mean by that?

AI: Sure! I'm wondering about skills that AI might be able to help with or even handle entirely - like lesson planning, creating rubrics, or generating educational content. Do you ever think about whether relying on AI for certain tasks might affect your own ability to do those things? Or is that not really a concern for you?

User: Ah, well, as I mentioned, lesson planning, quizzes, worksheets, these are all things that teachers frequently "take" from other teachers and modify anyway. I see AI as a similar approach- especially when you consider that the design of AI requires it to learn from human-produced work. Additionally, the nature of teaching requires a very detailed and personal insight into each specific classroom and child. It's the kind of thought process that couldn't be replicated, no matter how much information I provided about my specific situation. Ask any teacher, and they will have hundreds of stories about how they have had to modify a lesson last-minute to suit the individual needs of a class or student. That's all, not mentioning the fact that AI is still pretty error-ridden, and, frankly, might be forever (if you consider that the only way to be sure it isn't is to have a human check it). As such, it wouldn't make sense to base a child's education on AI without direct supervision. Finally, there are already a multitude of online education examples for children. Typically, these children tend to do worse, learn less, and struggle more without the supervision of a human educator. Anyways- so no, I think there will always be a capacity in education where humans are necessary and, as such, will not lose their skills. The only area of concern I could see being a problem would be creativity. Although I like to do creative processes myself, I could definitely see a reliance on AI for speed and efficiency causing my creative sword to dull.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're highlighting how teaching requires this constant real-time adaptation that's deeply human. And your point about creativity is particularly interesting, since you mentioned earlier that's something you really value doing yourself.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops?

User: Potentially - it's hard to know what future technology might look like. Typically, it seems to always be something we would have never thought possible at one point or another. As far as current AI technology stands (creative, factual, image/video creation, etc.) I don't necessarily see my use changing - but, hopefully, getting better, more reliable, effective, and efficient as AI progresses.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI fits naturally into the existing ecosystem of shared educational resources, and your nuanced view of where human expertise remains irreplaceable in teaching.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've described both the practical benefits and the limitations you've encountered - it gives us a much clearer picture of how AI is actually being integrated into real work environments.

Have a great rest of your day!
