Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it mostly for administrative tasks. I'm the head of a maths department at a virtual school, and a maths teacher, so I use it to summarise 1:1 lessons with students to give a short report for the parents. I also use it to come up with to do lists, and sometimes if I'm having trouble phrasing something in the correct way I will ask it to change the tone of something I've written. I also occasionally use AI to create lesson content, such as maths questions to use.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of uses. When you mention using AI to create maths questions for lessons, how does that process typically work for you? Do you give it specific parameters or examples to work from?

User: Yes, so for example I might say something like 'give me ten questions on multiplying mixed numbers. They should increase in difficulty.'

AI: That makes sense. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned several different types of tasks - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are some tasks where I think it would take too long for AI to format the task in the way I would need, and therefore I find it quicker and easier to do it myself. For example, creating Knowledge Organisers.

AI: Tell me more about that. What is it about creating Knowledge Organisers that makes it quicker for you to handle directly rather than working with AI?

User: We format our knowledge organisers in a specific way, and we have to use school branding - I think it would take too long to get an AI model to understand which branding to use when, and to format it how I would like it to look.

AI: That makes perfect sense - the specificity of formatting and branding requirements. When you do use AI for work tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: More likely to collaborate. Occasionally I will delegate though.

AI: Can you walk me through what that collaboration typically looks like? For instance, when you're working on something like summarizing a lesson for parents, how does that back-and-forth process unfold?

User: So to start with, I would ask AI to write a report on the lesson, giving the lesson content, what went well, and what we will continue to work on. Lets say the AI gave 'turning improper fractions to mixed numbers' to work on, but I think the student's main focus should be homework completion instead, I would say 'homework completion should be the main area to work on'.

AI: That's a great example of the collaborative process. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My school is very pro-AI, so it is spoken a lot more on a day-to-day basis than in previous careers, so it encourages me to think of using AI in more situations.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes, so there was a time where AI was refusing to write the 1:1 report that lesson, despite being given the exact same prompt that I had been using for months. I was very frustrated.

AI: That sounds really frustrating, especially when it was something that had been working consistently. What do you think was different about that particular situation? Were you able to figure out what was causing the issue?

User: There was nothing different in terms of the situation - I think the AI model must have been updated.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think teaching is an area that AI would struggle to take over with, because part of school is the social aspect. While AI may be able to teach maths, it can't teach how to socialise.

AI: That's an interesting perspective on the social elements of teaching. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I anticipate on using it more and more in the workplace. As AI models become more advance, so will their usefulness.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how teaching has that irreplaceable social component that AI can't replicate.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI fits into educational settings - from the collaborative approach you take with lesson summaries to the importance of that human social element in teaching - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It was really valuable to hear about both the practical applications you've found and the challenges you've encountered, like when familiar prompts suddenly stopped working. Thanks for being so generous with your time today.
