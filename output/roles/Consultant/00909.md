Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you?

User: Yeah

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Typically I do a lot of financial modeling and analysis in my day-to-day. Our workplace is currently in the process of evaluating our revenue streams and understanding where growth is and whether we are growing at a fast or slow pace. I'm very much ingrained in the actual monthly/weekly sales numbers but it's difficult figuring out what details are important to communicate to upper management - think founder and other C-suite executives. To that end, AI helps me figure out what pieces of data may be important to communicate and how to format it in such a way that upper management would get the picture - kind of answering the "so what" of all the data I collect. As for the financial modeling aspect, our brand is typically asked to do certain programs (we are in the consumer packaged goods industry and our customers are grocers in the US) and we essentially need to figure out how much it will cost us and model potential ROI. I would then plug in certain costs that grocers would ask of us, input our own values (COGS, margins, etc.) and then provide different ranges for certain costs based on performance.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're dealing with two distinct types of work - the data synthesis and communication piece, and the actual financial modeling calculations.

Tell me more about that first part where AI helps you figure out what's important to communicate to leadership. What does that process actually look like when you're working with AI on that?

User: So for me, I'm someone who likes a lot of detail. Like I need to know every aspect of whatever I get into so that I don't overlook anything. But the problem is upper management doesn't care about detail, they just want you to make their lives easier and tell them what to do. That's the part I struggle with. I've realized through working with AI and the results I've been getting with upper management is that you need to basically tell them what the answer is, show that you've done the work to come to that conclusion, then provide the next steps. With regards to the process specifically, I'll essentially tell AI: here's what I'm doing, here's what I'm trying to communicate, here's the work I've done so far, can you help me parse out what details I should include and what is the best way to communicate it concisely.

AI: That's a fascinating insight about the tension between your detail-oriented approach and what leadership actually needs. 

When you give AI all that context - your work, what you're trying to communicate - how does it typically respond? Does it give you a structured format, or does it help you think through the priorities differently?

User: So AI does a great job of understanding what I'm trying to say - but that's only if I give it a lot of detail. The more detail I give it, the more understanding I put into my prompts, the better AI is able to understand my intentions. So I've learned to basically input all of my thoughts and intentions into AI to be able to get the understanding I want. AI would typically give me a structured format, as in it would give me a specific point to include in my presentation, then explain the effects it would have. For example,  I would outline the entire task I've been given by management, and then ask if the AI understands what I'm trying to do. Once it's able to understand what I want it to do, I then give more specific information - such as the COGS, margin, etc. - and it would give me an answer in terms of numeric value. It would then give me a way to frame this to upper management, while explaining what this would convey to them. AI actually only helps me think through priorities differently when I'm unsure of how to proceed with the task I've been given, but whenever I'm sure about what I want to do it will just go along with my approach until I question it.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've developed a pretty deliberate process for getting AI to understand your full context before asking it to help structure your output.

You mentioned that AI "only helps me think through priorities differently when I'm unsure of how to proceed." Can you give me an example of a time when you were unsure and AI actually helped shift how you were thinking about approaching a task?

User: I'll give you a very specific example. We wanted to launch a new product at Sprouts, but this product was a part of the Frozen Meals category. This category has over 100 SKUs, and the price ranges from $3.99 to $14.99. Our product specifically would retail for around $4.99, so I initially wanted to evaluate other products that retail for the same price so that I could evaluate their velocities and sales to make a model for our own products, just to get a baseline expectation for modeling. The problem was, there weren't that many SKUs that retail for $4.99,  but there were many SKUs that retailed for $3.99, $4.49, $5.49, around that range. AI eventually helped me group these into price bands, comparing our $4.99 product to products that existed within the $4.49 - $5.49 band. I then thought, should I evaluate retail price per ounce? Our price is $4.99 for 10 oz., but products that are $4.49 could be 12 oz., $5.49 products could be 8 oz., so I'm like, maybe I could truly determine value by looking at retail price per ounce. This is exactly what I mean by, I want to know as much detail as possible so that I'm not overlooking anything. But this level of scrutiny might not even matter, right? So I asked the AI what I should do. The AI essentially gave me a breakdown that it would be useful in different situations, as in it depends on how you want to use the analysis. It gave me scenarios in which retail price per ounce would be useful, and when it's getting too granular. It then looked at my overall situation, then applied which form of analysis would be the most appropriate for the task at hand. The conclusion it gave me was that, don't overcomplicate by making price/ounce the primary analysis, but definitely include it as a supporting lens, especially if pack sizes vary. So that's how it helped shift how I thought about approaching this task.

AI: That's a perfect example of how AI helped you step back from getting lost in the weeds. It sounds like it gave you permission, in a way, to not dive as deep as your instincts were telling you to.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you like a lot of detail and want to know every aspect - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I'm still learning about the business, myself, so I essentially want to learn how financial modeling works, what works and what doesn't work, and I'll need to do that trial and error myself. AI currently is helping me fact-check myself and making sure I'm not getting stuck in the details or overlooking anything. But eventually I'd like AI to keep tabs on our workplace's current decisions. For example, say we commit to a program, and we've modeled that it would cost x and have an ROI of y. I would like AI to be able to evaluate how effective the model was when the costs and ROI become reality. Right now we're not at that stage yet as we're just now incorporating AI into our workplace practices, but eventually I would like to see it keep track of all our business practices, such as what products we sell, where we sell them, what our retail costs are, and what our growth looks like. Then I'd like to be able to plug in actual financials, not just revenue but expenses as well. Are we actually making money or not? AI would essentially be an employee that helps us organize ourselves, as an efficient way to organize ourselves instead of having them in documents or emails.

AI: That vision of AI as an organizational memory that tracks decisions and outcomes over time is really compelling. It sounds like you see a clear progression from where you are now - using it for structuring and fact-checking - to this more comprehensive tracking role.

Right now, when you're using AI for those financial models and analysis, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it everything upfront and have it handle a complete piece independently?

User: Going back to the example of launching a product at Sprouts, one of the asks was to run a specific promotional program. We would essentially be funding a portion of this program so that our product could be discounted for the duration of the sale. We would need to model how much this would cost us, given performance expectations (since we would receive chargebacks per unit, meaning the more units sold = more chargebacks). In consumer packaged goods, the essential point of running a promo is so your baseline would increase - that would effectively be the ROI. From a financial perspective though, that doesn't make any sense. My CEO cares about the latter, and my CSO cares about the former, so you can see how I'm essentially bridging the gap with my analysis. Coming back to how AI fits into all of this, I give it a lot of detail up front. Here is what competitors' baselines are, here is our expected performance, here is our expected chargebacks, and I would basically ask it how much would our baseline need to increase so that the promotional program effectively pays for itself. The actual math part the model would do independently, while I would try to figure out the communication piece to determine if the program is worth running or not.

AI: That's a great example of how you're using AI to handle the computational heavy lifting while you focus on the strategic interpretation and communication challenges. It sounds like you've found a clear division of labor there.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others using it similarly, or are you kind of pioneering this approach?

User: Our team is quite small, and our exposure to AI has been relatively recent - think 3-4 months. They're still using it in the typical way, like helping to write emails, but I'm really the one pioneering the approach of having it be a consultant for us. I think there's still a learning gap between how to effectively use AI. Throughout my experience, I've learned that the AI can't figure out how you think, so you need to basically feed it as much of your own thoughts as possible so that the AI could be on the same page as you. Kind of like humans, yeah?

AI: That's such a great observation - that you need to feed AI your own thinking process to get it on the same page with you. It sounds like you've become the informal AI expert in your small team.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: My experience has mostly been satisfactory, especially when I provide enough context to get what I want, but there are some nuances where it can be particularly frustrating. It's not the AI's fault, rather it's a reflection of the lack of insight into our own business practices. Long story short, we basically needed a calculator to figure out pallet configurations that would a) satisfy the customer's requirements and b) make sure we're not overspending on freight. The problem essentially was, because we didn't know how we were reconciling freight, everything that the model would output in terms of a functional calculator was wrong. Like I said, it wasn't the AI's fault, we just weren't aware of how to reconcile freight, but the problem was we ourselves didn't know that, and the AI just took our word for it that what we were providing was correct, so it erred on the side of caution. So that was particularly frustrating, but it was essentially our own lack of knowledge into what we really needed.

AI: That's such an insightful example - it really highlights how AI can only be as good as the understanding and information you bring to it. It sounds like the AI was actually working correctly, but it exposed gaps in your own business processes that you didn't even realize existed.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Good question, it is something I actively consider. With the whole "AI will take over your jobs" rhetoric, it really becomes a question of how you use it, not what you're using it for. I'm sure this rhetoric was the same when the Internet was becoming a thing. You just have to adapt. If you don't, THEN you'll lose your job. I think about my own skills of being able to speak to AI to get what I want, so I could effectively transition to our company's AI consultant, doing financial analysis on the side while also making it efficient for our business practices.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing AI as a tool that changes how you work rather than something that replaces you entirely. Your idea of becoming your company's AI consultant while maintaining your financial analysis expertise is interesting.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I basically envision AI being able to be a scorekeeper for our business - keeping track of our revenue and expenses. We would plug in our business decisions, and it would help us understand the financial impact so that we could better strategize.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI can only be as good as the context and understanding you bring to it - that example about the freight reconciliation really illustrated how AI can expose gaps in our own business processes.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we've covered everything.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing that detailed prompting approach, using AI as a bridge between your analytical detail and executive communication needs, and your vision of AI as an organizational memory system will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the successes and the frustrations - those real examples give us such valuable perspective on how people are actually integrating these tools into their work. Thank you again!
