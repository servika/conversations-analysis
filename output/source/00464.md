Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, I don't have any questions, we can begin!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostly use AI for automating some previously manual processes, as well as providing additional clarification or perspectives I should consider within my role. I also use it to help communicate difficult ideas and to analyze data on occasion.

AI: That's a great overview. I'd love to hear more specifics about one of those areas. When you mention using AI to help communicate difficult ideas, could you walk me through what that actually looks like in practice?

User: Using AI to communicate difficult ideas means if I have something I need to express to another co-worker that may not be the best news, I use AI to help me figure out a way to "break the news" in a more positive or less harsh way. I also use it to help me gather my thoughts when I have a lot of ideas swirling but can't come up with something cohesive.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're using AI to help you gather those swirling thoughts into something cohesive, how do you typically work with it? Do you dump all your ideas and let it organize them, or is it more of a back-and-forth conversation where you're building the final result together?

User: It depends on the day, but typically I will dump a summary of most or all of the ideas and let the AI work with it/organize them. On occasion if I am really struggling with organizing my thoughts I will have a back and forth conversation where we build on the ideas and results, with changes occurring between each turn.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, I prefer to handle my "easy" tasks on my own. Things that aren't super manual or require a whole lot of brainpower to handle, I just take care of those. The main reason I do it myself is because I use AI for so many other things, I need to make sure I still have full control over some part of my work.

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned wanting to maintain "full control over some part of your work." Tell me more about that. What does having that control mean to you?

User: It means providing results that are 100% mine, not influenced or effected by outside sources (other co-workers, AI, etc.).

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not particularly. Most of my direct co-workers are older and don't understand AI so they don't use it.

AI: Since your colleagues aren't really using AI, how does that affect your experience? Do you find yourself keeping your AI use more private, or do you openly discuss it with them?

User: I definitely keep it more private, unless I have a great breakthrough or progress on something important that AI has helped with, in which case I tell them that AI helped in an attempt to influence them towards trying it.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes! A few months back I had a very messy schedule and worked for hours attempting to get it cleaned up without angering too many customers due to the adjustments we had to make. I gave AI a summary of the current schedule, the changes I needed to make, and the limitations in place (don't miss customer promised ship dates if possible, parts are delaying these orders, etc.) and it helped me clean up my schedule in an extremely organized way in a matter of minutes! I was about 4 hours deep at that point and was so happy but also incredibly frustrated with myself for spending so much time instead of getting help.

AI: That's such a vivid example - thank you for sharing that. When you reflect on being "incredibly frustrated with yourself," how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: This is something I consider, and that's why I do not fully rely on AI to do every task or job. When I do delegate something to AI, I take extra care to double check the results and edit as needed to ensure that not only my skills are maintained, but also so that I have contributed in some form to the task or project.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think my relationship with AI at work will continue to evolve and flourish. I will continue to use it for more complex tasks, and it will help me achieve the goals and results I need.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining control over certain tasks to ensure you have results that are "100% yours" - that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while preserving your own contribution seems really important to you.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with maintaining your own skills, and especially that scheduling example, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating AI into your work while being intentional about where you draw those boundaries. Take care!
