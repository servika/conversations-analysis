Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sure, that sounds great! No, thanks.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I often use AI to quickly help me problem solve something. Usually, it's a task that I've tried to solve myself, but I'm stuck on. I'm a teacher, so this might be verifying that a sentence I've typed in an email makes sense, or it might be brainstorming ways to get my students more engaged in a lesson. I never do any of this when students are in the room. It's usually at the end of the day, when I can catch my breath and plan some things.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI serves as a problem-solving partner when you hit roadblocks. 

Tell me more about that moment when you realize you're stuck and decide to turn to AI. What does that decision-making process look like for you?

User: It's almost like the feeling of wanting to have a friend validate my idea or it might mean that I've tried to look up some lesson ideas and things just don't quite feel right. For both of these scenarios, that's when I will usually pull out AI to try to get a different perspective.

AI: That validation piece is fascinating - using AI almost like bouncing ideas off a trusted colleague. 

When you're looking for that different perspective, what happens next? Do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI, or do you typically get what you need in that first exchange?

User: Yeah, it depends. Sometimes I will send my question to the AI and it will immediately give me what I need (for example, a restructured sentence that suddenly sounds "just right"), and other times, I might need to provide additional information or re-focus the direction that the AI took. 

For example, maybe my students are struggling with learning division in Math. I've looked up the curriculum already, I've tried researching and implementing different strategies, and I've asked a colleague, but nothing seems to help. At this point in time, I may send a quick message to AI describing the situation, and see what it says. If it tells me something I already know, I would say, "I've already tried that, and this happened ____," and it will reassess and give me some other thoughts.

AI: That's such a clear example of how you navigate that back-and-forth process. I'm struck by how you mentioned you've already tried the curriculum, research, and asked a colleague before turning to AI.

What makes you decide to go to AI at that point rather than, say, asking another colleague or looking for more resources elsewhere?

User: I enjoy the ease and effectiveness that I've gotten from AI in the past, so I've learned to pull it out and use it as a tool to help in these types of situations. It's efficient, and although AI makes mistakes sometimes, I usually can fact-check things in a faster way once the AI has formulated the organized information.

AI: That efficiency factor seems really important to you. You mentioned that AI sometimes makes mistakes but you can fact-check faster once it's organized the information.

Can you walk me through what that fact-checking process looks like for you? How do you verify what AI gives you?

User: It usually means first asking the AI if it's correct, and sometimes I will ask it to provide me with sources. Otherwise, I might quickly look it up myself, and if the AI was wrong, I will let it know and have it make adjustments to whatever it had originally sent.

AI: That's a really practical approach - almost like having a built-in feedback loop. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you as a teacher?

User: For sure. Anything that is confidential or student-specific is always handled by me. I do not ever send anything that includes personal information for my students or their parents. Usually, I just use AI as a quick language tool to double check the wording of things, or to help me research information. 

I enjoy the creative functions of AI as well, but sometimes it's more practical for me to solve things. For example, in theory, I could ask AI to help me make a poster to put up in my class based on what we are learning. I find that many AI models are not quite perfected in this, and there are often spelling mistakes or the images look too "AI-like". These types of things I still do on my own, but I might ask for a well-organized formulated list or a funny pun that my students would enjoy seeing.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - keeping student information completely off-limits while still finding creative ways to use AI for classroom materials. The poster example is particularly interesting.

When you mentioned that AI-generated images look too "AI-like," what is it that you or your students notice? What gives it away?

User: It might mean that it looks almost cartoon-like when it shouldn't, or maybe there's an extra finger or hand on a person. Usually it's something that's subtle, but when you look close enough, you notice it. I've seen someone try to make a poster of something in a classroom, and in the background, there's an alphabet banner on the wall. When you really examine the alphabet closely, you will see that there are some letters missing.

AI: Those subtle details really make a difference in a classroom setting where students are naturally observant. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that other teachers are approaching it similarly, or are there different perspectives in your school?

User: No, I wouldn't say so. Truthfully, none of them know that I sometimes use it. I do know that in general, there are many people who are a bit wary of AI. This may have to do with the idea that it's harming the environment, that it has taken away some jobs, or that people think AI will "take over the world". I have found it to be a helpful tool, but it's important to recognize that it is a tool, so its use depends on you, and it makes mistakes.

AI: That's really striking - that you're finding it helpful but keeping it private because of those broader concerns your colleagues have.

What's it like navigating that gap between your positive experience with AI and the wariness you sense from others? Does that influence how you think about using it?

User: Well, the wariness hasn't come from any coworkers, so it's not really relevant. It's moreso what I've seen online than in-person. The concerns are important to me though, so usually if I see something that makes me unsure, I look it up.

AI: Got it - so it's more about those broader societal conversations you've encountered online rather than direct workplace tensions. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: For sure. The most satisfied that I feel is usually when I've been stuck on a problem for a long time, and I finally feel like I have a solution thanks to AI. This might be that I've written an email and read it over a few times, but something just doesn't feel "right" yet. I might ask AI what it thinks, and it will help me to phrase it in a smoother way.

The only times when I've felt frustrated were when the AI gave me something that was factually incorrect or it hallucinated something. It makes me feel like I can't trust it in those moments, and I don't like that. For example, maybe I sent a message asking about a historical event, and it gave me the wrong year that the event happened. I don't like it when that happens because then the whole task is less efficient: I have to verify it, and I might then really go back and verify some previous claims made by the AI.

AI: That trust issue really resonates - when AI gets something factually wrong, it seems to create this ripple effect where you question other things it's told you.

When those moments happen where you lose that trust, how do you rebuild it? Do you find yourself being more cautious for a while, or does it bounce back pretty quickly?

User: I find myself being more cautious, for sure, and then as it continues to give me well-grounded answers, I find myself trusting it again. To be clear though, I never fully trust it. It's like when you're researching something, and you get information from Wikipedia. It's a great website, but it can be edited by the public, so it's not always truthful.

AI: That Wikipedia comparison is really apt - a useful starting point that you know needs verification. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it more, differently, or in new ways as a teacher?

User: I would say that as AI continues to advance, I will likely continue to use it for similar situations, but I hope that my trust in it grows. I can see myself using it to help with more organizational needs, like building a unit plan. I will definitely continue to use it to help me problem solve different situations.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that healthy skepticism while still finding AI genuinely useful as a problem-solving partner.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's it! Thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a trusted-but-verified problem-solving partner, and how you navigate the privacy considerations as a teacher, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!

User: Thank you, you too!

AI: Thank you! It was really great talking with you. Take care!
