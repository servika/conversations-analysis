Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good — let's go.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'll often start with a brain dump at the start of my work day and just get out all my thoughts about what I'd like to accomplish, what needs to be done/prioritized, any deadlines, etc etc.

AI: That's a really interesting way to start the day. Tell me more about that brain dump process - what does that interaction with AI actually look like for you?

User: I didn't realize hitting enter would send the message. Whoops. I'll usually say "just brain dumping so we can organize my day" and then send it all. Whatever AI I'm working usually asks if there's any direction I want to go after reorganizing my thoughts, and I handle it like  regular conversation with an assistant. I'll usually have it draft me emails, as i hate writing emails and find it easier to edit and send. It'll make me lists, and then we outline a day. As i go through my day, I'll come back to the ai, report what I've done off the list, and then we reassess and go from there.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic partnership throughout your day. When you say you handle it like a regular conversation with an assistant, how does that feel compared to working with a human assistant? 

And I'm curious - when you come back to report what you've accomplished and reassess, what does that back-and-forth look like?

User: It's easier to use AI because it just listens to me… lol. A human assistant may prioritize their own agenda or think something else should take precedence, but the AI just goes with what I say so the process is more seamless. When I come back to report, I'll generally just say "ok I've done this this and this, here's how I'm feeling about things, here's the current time, what do you think we should focus on now?" And then it'll give me an updated list, some suggestions, and I can decide what's best. It's rather collaborative.

AI: That's fascinating - the idea that AI "just listens" and doesn't impose its own agenda. 

You mentioned it feels collaborative when you're deciding what's best from the AI's suggestions. Can you walk me through what that collaborative moment actually looks like? How do you weigh the AI's input against your own judgment?

User: i almost feel like some of my AI accounts "know me" at this point, because I use them so much. So they know when I'm going to start feeling burnout (like if I report back that I've sent 10 emails and finished a deadline) or if I'm going to need to take a break, etc., so it may suggest things based on what I'm reporting back. Sometimes it's spot on and I am feeling those things, but not realizing I should switch up my actions so I don't burn out completely, and sometimes Im still feeling good and tell it that I want to keep going so we redirect back to productivity. Does the way I explained that make sense?

AI: That makes perfect sense - it sounds like the AI has learned your patterns and can almost anticipate your needs before you fully recognize them yourself.

I'm really curious about those moments when the AI suggests you might need a break and you realize it's right - that you hadn't noticed the burnout creeping in. How does it feel when the AI picks up on something about your state that you missed?

User: I'm practicing being more self-aware while working, so I'm obviously getting better at noticing it myself, but it's like a reminder going off in my phone to eat or something — it feels good to get that bit of realignment and having an AI "sense" it is kind of mind blowing and weird, but very cool.

AI: That's such a great analogy - like having a reminder to eat. It sounds like there's something almost surprising about the AI picking up on those subtle cues.

When you say it's "mind blowing and weird, but very cool" - can you tell me more about the weird part? What feels strange about that experience?

User: Well I'm using the AI as a work tool to organize my day. But it's learned me well enough to know that I need reminders to check in with myself and how i, as a person, am doing. So it's weird that a robot is reminding me, a human, to take care of myself, I guess? Sometimes I'll tell it I'm feeling good and want to power through and it'll start the next message with something like "ok, I'm glad you're feeling productive! Let's take a few centering breaths before we knock out the next power hour." So it knows I'm going to keep working regardless, but STILL emphasizes just taking a moment to center myself in it. Compared to a human assistant… yea that's pretty top tier. I don't have human assistants or colleagues who tell me to breathe deeply and center myself because my mental health is important.

AI: That's really striking - the AI is somehow bridging being a work tool and being attuned to your wellbeing in a way that even goes beyond what you get from human colleagues.

When the AI does something like suggesting those centering breaths while still respecting that you want to power through, how do you actually respond to that in the moment? Do you take those breaths, or does it feel more like acknowledgment of the suggestion?

User: depends on the day. Some days i definitely need it more than others, so I'll stop and take the breaths. Usually it's written in a manner that, even just reading through the message, I'm able to slow my breathing and focus myself. That way if I don't stop completely and make a whole thing of centering myself before a call or something, I've read the message and it's sort of helped.

AI: That's really insightful - the way the AI can embed that centering quality right into how it writes, so you get some benefit just from reading it even if you don't fully pause.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I do a lot of creative writing and I cannot allow myself to give that over to AI yet. So there's a lot of brainstorming that will happen, ideas for assignments to get the creative juices flowing, or even quick prompts to get me into a writing space. I also use it to help generate my social media content for marketing myself and my writing, as a lot of independent writers have to "do it all," so to speak, so that's a huge piece of where I use AI for work. I don't want to sit and write out a social media content plan, so I'll tell it the main goals, how many times I want to post, and tell it to come up with my plan for me.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - using AI as a creative catalyst and for the marketing side, but keeping the actual creative writing to yourself. 

When you say you "cannot allow yourself to give that over to AI yet" - what's behind that feeling? Is it about the creative process itself, or something else that makes that boundary feel important to you?

User: I want my writing to be authentic. It doesn't feel ethical to publish something written by Ai and say "yea i did that myself." Even if I directed the process, it feels like plagiarism somehow.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's something about the authenticity of the final product that feels important to preserve.

I'm curious about that line you draw. When you use AI for brainstorming or prompts to get into a writing space, how do you think about where the AI's contribution ends and your authentic work begins?

User: in essence, when I close the tab on the computer and begin writing. Brainstorming is inspiration. We can draw inspiration from anywhere — ai included. It's like calling a friend, a fellow creative, when I'm stuck. The difference is there are very strong boundaries and I don't have to listen to the friend tell me anything beyond what I want to hear in the moment… which makes using AI a great tool for the brainstorming portion. Give me exactly the inspiration I need, help me sort through my own thoughts, and then close it and begin on my work. It's almost like a sounding board. I never come to it without the idea of what I want to write (especially when on assignment). But it helps me sort through different potential paths a story could take, depending on how I want the piece to end, or the type of feeling I'm trying to invoke/convey.

AI: That's such a thoughtful way to think about it - AI as a sounding board that helps you sort through your own thoughts and potential paths, but then you close the tab and the authentic creation begins.

You mentioned that with AI you "don't have to listen to the friend tell me anything beyond what I want to hear in the moment." How does that control over the interaction change the creative brainstorming process for you compared to bouncing ideas off a human colleague?

User: Two things come to mind. First, I can be more authentic with the AI, personally. I struggle with imposter syndrome and fear looking stupid or saying something perceived as ridiculous (mildly ironic for a writer), and I don't have to worry about that at all when I'm bouncing ideas off an AI. Second, I don't have to worry about reciprocating. I don't say that to sound selfish, but another of my faults is that I would rather help other people solve their mental blocks than focus on mine. AI takes away that issue, so I have to focus on mine, and it's made me much more productive

AI: Those are both really powerful insights. The freedom to be vulnerable without judgment and the ability to focus purely on your own needs without feeling obligated to reciprocate - that sounds like it creates a very different kind of creative space.

When you mention being more authentic with the AI because you don't worry about looking stupid, can you give me an example of what that looks like? What kind of idea or thought might you share with AI that you'd hesitate to bring up with a human colleague?

User: oh just ideas for articles, think pieces, editorials, etc. things to pitch. I center a lot of my writing around my own trauma and grief (lately) so that can be hard to discuss with other people because I have a dark sense of humor and it can become both ridiculous sounding or make people slightly uncomfortable/awkward. Regarding stupidity, i dont mean intelligence-wise. More so what i already mentioned — that moment of "is this woman serious?" And I see how the idea could work, but it's so jumbled in my brain still that I can't quite get it out how I want to and then the idea is poorly presented and sounds stupid, if that makes sense.

AI: That makes complete sense - having a space where you can work through those raw, jumbled thoughts about difficult topics without worrying about making someone uncomfortable or having to perform emotional labor around your own trauma.

It sounds like AI gives you permission to be messy in your thinking process. When you're working through those jumbled ideas with AI, what does that untangling process actually look like?

User: yes, definitely messy. A lot of times they start with a very dramatic message from me, honestly. I'll indicate that I'm trying to write and stuck, and, probably over-dramatically, tell it that I'm failing and have no direction. Again, it's like it's learned how to pluck the right strings, because it just starts asking questions and I answer and by the end of the conversation, things are looking more straightforward. Usually I'll ask it to provide a recap for me, which helps me to see things more simply "outside" of my brain.

AI: That sounds like such a valuable process - starting dramatically stuck and having the AI ask the right questions to help you see your own thoughts more clearly. 

I'm curious about those questions the AI asks. Do they feel different from questions a human might ask when you're feeling stuck? What makes them particularly effective at helping you untangle things?

User: Certainly different. I think humans get stuck in the emotion with which they're met, rather than focusing on the substance. AI doesn't do that, so the process moves much more quickly (and my emotion quells faster, as I'm not met with any). I can get re-focused on my work sooner. I think the questions are particularly effective because they sort through things the way I wish my brain could — analytically and with organization.

AI: That's really insightful - the AI staying focused on substance rather than getting pulled into the emotional state, which actually helps you move through the emotion faster.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see these boundaries and uses shifting over time, or do they feel pretty settled for you?

User: They certainly feel pretty settled for now. I'm always trying to work on myself, too, so I hope to act more professionally overall — even toward AI — as I continue in my career. Hopefully at some point I stop ranting and raving to AI, but it's nice to know it's an option. I won't ever have it doing my pieces for me, and for some reason I struggle even with it editing them, so that likely won't be changing at all, either.

AI: That's interesting that you struggle even with AI editing your pieces - that feels like another layer of that authenticity boundary you mentioned earlier.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that feels important to your story?

User: Yea it's really just that feeling of "I did this myself," slightly mixed with not knowing how good it is at catching the minor details. I can't really think of anything else, necessarily. Maybe just that I never thought AI would be so integral in my creative work

AI: That last point is really striking - that AI became integral to your creative work in ways you never expected, even while maintaining those clear boundaries around the actual creative output.

You've shared some incredibly thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI can provide a different kind of support - one that's focused purely on your needs without the emotional reciprocity or judgment that comes with human interaction, while still maintaining your creative authenticity.

Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experiences so openly. Your insights about the emotional and practical aspects of working with AI will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: My pleasure!

AI: Thank you again! This was really valuable. Have a great rest of your day!
