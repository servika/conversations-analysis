Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use AI everyday as I am well versed in how to complete my day to day tasks, however, there are occasions where I am doing something new or unfamiliar where I turn to AI for a different perspective. An example would be when I'm dealing with a new area of tenancy law, or perhaps want some advice on how to structure an important email

AI: That's really interesting - so you use AI more as a resource for those unfamiliar situations rather than for routine work. 

When you mentioned getting a "different perspective" on something like tenancy law, can you tell me more about what that looks like? How does AI's perspective differ from other resources you might turn to?

User: I wouldn't say that I require a different perspective on tenancy law. I would use an AI for a different perspective on how to structure an email or overcome an interpersonal obstacle. An AI can be helpful with legal questions as a jumping off platform to make sure I'm not overlooking basic legislation or sections within, say, the Residential Tenancies Act. Once asking an AI I will go through my usual process of double checking the legislation myself

AI: That makes perfect sense - so AI serves different roles depending on the task. For legal questions, it's more of a safety net to catch anything you might have missed, while for things like email structure or interpersonal challenges, you're actually seeking that outside perspective.

When you're dealing with those interpersonal obstacles, what is it about AI's perspective that you find helpful compared to, say, asking a colleague or friend?

User: Before turning to a colleague or friend I believe it's my job to do everything I can to do the best work possible. That way when I do reach out to others for help they're able to offer more specific advice and offer suggestions I couldn't think of myself

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using AI as part of your own due diligence before involving others. It sounds like you see AI as helping you come more prepared to those human conversations.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to do most tasks myself, technically I know that an AI could write every email I send. I find that by the time I write a prompt that covers everything I would need to write in an email, check the response for errors/personalise the text, I would be better off writing it myself. This is why I prefer to limit my AI use to more complicated situations, rather than laborious tasks

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - you've identified that for routine emails, the overhead of prompting and checking actually makes it less efficient than just doing it yourself. But for complex situations, that trade-off shifts.

When you do use AI for those more complicated situations, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout working through the problem, or do you tend to give it the full context upfront and let it handle the task more independently?

User: Typically what I will do is provide as much context as possible for the problem I am trying to overcome, as well as my objective. Then I will interact with the AI until I have sufficient information to continue on my own. The final step of the process is always my own independent thinking and I take it upon myself to double check everything

AI: That's a clear workflow - comprehensive context upfront, interactive dialogue to gather what you need, then independent execution and verification on your end. It sounds like you maintain clear ownership of the final output.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has their approach affected how you think about using these tools?

User: The nature of my work is very independent, I don't necessarily have other colleagues. However, I have spoken to friends who work in similar environments and they have given me tips on how to incorporate AI in an efficient way.

AI: That makes sense - so those conversations with friends in similar work have helped shape your approach. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Recently I was writing a delicate email to a client that was quite upset. I remember having read a book by Dale Carnegie which contained a lot of great advice on how to deal with these sorts of situations. Unfortunately, I had leant that book to a friend so I didn't have it on hand. I asked the AI to rattle off a list of advice from that book. The AI did this well and I was able to access that information very easily.

AI: That's a great example of AI helping you access knowledge you knew existed but couldn't physically reach. It sounds like it worked well as a kind of external memory in that moment.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Personally I don't think that AI can effectively do my job, I work in an industry that has a heavy focus on face to face interactions and personal relationships. I do worry that AI could potentially leave me lazy and incapable of solving problems for myself, but so far I think there's a healthy balance

AI: That's a thoughtful balance you're striking - recognizing both the relationship-heavy nature of your work and being mindful of not becoming overly dependent. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As it stands I don't see my daily use of AI changing very much, though I appreciate that the technology is rapidly improving.

AI: That wraps up all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as part of your own due diligence process - doing your homework before reaching out to others - and how you've found that sweet spot where the overhead of using AI actually makes sense.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically for complex situations rather than routine tasks, and maintaining that careful balance to avoid dependency, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
