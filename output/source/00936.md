Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work for a credit union, and we built our own AI. We have one that tries to answer chats in our online banking before connecting to a representative and one that we just launched for internal use. For the one that we use in online banking, I monitor the conversations that come into my area to ensure AI is answering accurately. If not, I ask the same questions, rated it thumbs down, and submit feedback to help get it corrected. For the internal one, it can access our policies, job aids, HR information, our intranet, etc. I ask questions several times a day to get answers in there, usually about a process or something HR related.

AI: That's really interesting - you're working with AI from both sides, monitoring customer interactions and using it for your own work needs.

When you're monitoring those customer chat conversations, what does that process look like for you day-to-day? How do you decide when the AI's response needs correction?

User: I'm a manager in my area so can easily tell if AI gives an incorrect response. Since this information is to our members, it can damage reputation easily if incorrect. Plus we are regulated so we wouldn't want to violate any regulations, or offend anybody.

AI: That makes complete sense - the stakes are definitely high when you're dealing with member-facing information and regulatory requirements.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I am all about finding shortcuts and working smarter, not harder. There isn't anything I prefer to do myself if AI can help.

AI: That's a great perspective on efficiency! Since you're so open to AI assistance, I'm curious about how you typically interact with it.

When you use AI for work - especially that internal one that accesses your policies and HR information - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it throughout a task, or do you tend to ask it a complete question and get the answer you need right away?

User: I tend to ask a complete simple question that I need an answer right away. I'm usually asking for a specific question to a policy, something I need to answer my employees about, or just needing to know if we do or don't do something. This AI is very unreliable right now, hopefully just because it's new, but I keep asking to try to help get it trained. I just know to not rely too much on the answers I'm getting yet. Luckily I often know the answer, or have a good idea what it is, before I ask, so that helps me get through it.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you're being strategic about how you use it while it's still learning. You mentioned it's unreliable right now, but you keep using it to help train it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I often feel frustrated with it because it's so unreliable. We've had the one that interacts with the membership longer, and I had fun training that one. It seemed to make corrections faster than our internal one. The trick with it is trying to identify all the ways a member may ask a question, and that was challenging to me. I enjoy challenges. I felt good watching it improve. We also are about to convert to a new phone system, and we built "intents and occurrences" for members to speak what they want and try to direct to the right place. That hasn't gone live yet, and I'm very anxious to see if what I built for my area is successful.  Crossing my fingers.

AI: It sounds like you really enjoy the training and development aspect - especially seeing the AI improve over time. That upcoming phone system launch must be exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time!

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others as open to using it as you are?

User: Our credit union culture has one "pillar" that focuses on technology. My boss is very open to change. However, most my staff does not like change. It's been a huge challenge to get them to see that change is good in the long run. They try to think like that now, but sometimes revert back to wanting to stay in their comfort zone. I've had to work on my assistant to stop saying things like 'that's how it's always been' when talking about why our system operates the way it does.  I often ask 'but why does it do that?'.  The phone conversion will probably make a couple of senior employees decide to retire. lol

AI: It sounds like you're really driving change in your team while navigating some natural resistance! That "but why does it do that?" approach is such a great way to challenge the status quo.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do think about that, but dealing with membership, they still want some human interaction. There's more to our business than just provided the technology. I think my job will change over time, but I'll never be replaced.  Not at my level anyway. I can see downsizing my staff at some point because processes get easier, but we still need people.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - recognizing that the human element remains crucial, especially in member services.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this all heading for you and your team?

User: I think AI will make us faster and possibly more confident. One thing I didn't mention yet is that we also use a couple of resources for research. We are limited to what we can access, but we can use copilot. I use that a lot when researching regulations. It allows me to get answers much quicker, sometimes days quicker depending on how much research, plus gives me summaries for all the regulatory/legal words. I often tell my staff 'too many words' when they give me long explanations. I want concise and easy to understand. It also helps give me confidence if what I 'think' I know is correct.  So for management, faster decisions, more comprehensive decisions, and easy to read explanations so we can explain to members. For my staff who is on the front lines, we can use it to do some of the more mundane tasks so they can spend more time building the relationships that we focus on building as part of our strategic plan.

AI: That's such a comprehensive view of how AI can enhance different aspects of your work - from faster regulatory research to freeing up your staff for relationship building. It really sounds like you've thought through how it can support your strategic goals.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI to handle mundane tasks so your team can focus on member relationships - that strategic thinking about where human skills add the most value is really valuable.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I covered everything. For summary, our internal AI I use many times a day usually quick single questions. For our AI in our online banking, I'm monitoring those conversations for accuracy pretty much daily. In the beginning, some of those conversations were a little cringe-worthy. For research purposes, I use AI at least a few times a day and those are back and forth conversations until I fully understand my question.  I also often use it just to help me reword something since we're interacting with the public so much.

AI: Perfect - thank you for that great summary! It's really helpful to see the full picture of how you're using AI across different contexts, from those quick policy questions to the more collaborative research conversations to helping with member communications.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about both the challenges and opportunities of integrating AI into a regulated financial environment will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day, and best of luck with that phone system launch - I hope all those intents and occurrences you built work perfectly!
