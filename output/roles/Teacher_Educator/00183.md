Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I'm ready to start.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm an EFL teacher, and I work with Korean elementary school students. Most of my usage of AI comes into play when I'm preparing materials, like creating levelled dialogues and readings, vocabulary lists, thinking of new ways to check grammar or make sentence patterns stick, etc. Although my school has recently begun using some AI features with a digital textbook for the 3rd and 4th grade students, I don't usually have contact with that, the Korean teachers do instead. I'm more focused on getting authentic language experiences to them.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI primarily for lesson preparation rather than direct classroom instruction. 

When you're creating these leveled dialogues and readings, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you work with AI to get the materials just right for your elementary students?

User: Since I have a pretty solid idea of my students levels, I usually start by making a list of key vocabulary or key grammar points that I want to definitely have included for any materials or games that I make. Then, I create a prompt that asks for multiple versions (based on CEFR levels, because those are what I'm most familiar with) of a dialogue, a short story, a fill-in-the-blank, etc., and I set how long I'd like it to be ideally. If I like the initial materials created, or even if they're just close enough to what I was imagining, then I paste it into a standard word processor and do minor edits for either language or appearance. Something like setting the font to comic sans for 3rd grade, because they're still learning to write basic letters, or just spacing things out to leave room for writing after activities. And usually, after I've done that, I'll make my own comprehension questions, because I usually find the questions generated by AI are too rote or just too repetitive/templated.

AI: That's a fascinating workflow. It sounds like you've developed a really thoughtful approach to using AI as a starting point and then applying your own expertise to refine the materials.

Tell me more about that decision to create your own comprehension questions rather than using the AI-generated ones. What specifically makes the AI questions feel too rote or templated for your students?

User: The problem might have to do with me not subscribing to any premium AI services, but I've found that when I ask for multiple choice questions to be prepared, there's a more than 50 percent chance that every answer will be C. Or the options given for the multiple choice will be so wildly different that it doesn't really test any skills for the students; if only one single word is familiar or related to the topic of the reading, then it's extremely easy and obvious which one is correct, right? I also like making my own open-ended comprehension questions because even if I ask for a reading or dialogue that's CEFR A1, the actual questions given might be more suitable for a B1 or B2 learner, or just an ESL student instead of an EFL student. To clarify, the lexicon and comprehension of students learning English while also living in a country that speaks English is way more developed than that of students learning English abroad, especially in East Asia, even if they theoretically began learning at the exact same time.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making about ESL versus EFL learners - I hadn't considered how that context would affect the appropriateness of comprehension questions even when the source material is at the right level.

It sounds like you've identified some clear limitations in how AI currently handles these educational tasks. Given those challenges, are there certain types of lesson preparation tasks where you find AI works really well for you, versus others where you prefer to handle everything yourself from scratch?

User: I really like AI for actual idea generation, especially when it comes to finding either age-appropriate or culturally-relevant topics to base my materials off of. Even though I've been teaching Korean students for so long, I don't have my own children and therefore I don't usually have a clue what's popular among them. For example, the italian brainrot phenomena was a total mystery to me for the longest time, but AI gave me explanations and then helped me design some vocabulary games that were based around or inclusive of those characters, which really got my students excited. Similarly, there are aspects of Korean history and culture that are super prominent like Gyeongbokgung or Jeju Island, but those topics are kind of tired. AI is a great option for exploring other relevant topics, and then further narrowing them down to parts that are usable in my classes.

AI: That's such a smart way to use AI - leveraging it to bridge that gap between what's culturally relevant to your students and what you might naturally know about. The Italian brainrot example is particularly interesting!

When you're exploring these cultural topics with AI, how do you typically verify or validate that the suggestions it gives you are actually accurate and appropriate for your Korean students? Do you have ways of double-checking that information before you build lessons around it?

User: Usually, I look up the topics presented on something like Naver, Daum, or NamuWiki, which are popular Korean search engines and their version of Wikipedia. If it seems colorful, related to some kind of craft that I can incorporate into a review lesson, or just interesting but not related to either violence or insensitivity about other cultures, then I usually consider it appropriate for usage in class. I can also double-check with my Korean coworkers about anything I'm really unsure of, but that's rarely an issue. Since the variety of topics to choose from is so varied, it's not really a problem for me to just abandon anything that seems either too much effort or too complex to introduce to my students and just go with another.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having multiple Korean sources to cross-reference and the flexibility to just move on to different topics when something doesn't work out.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned using it for idea generation and initial material creation, but then doing significant editing yourself. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself from start to finish, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Again, this is likely related to my unwillingness to buy a subscription, but I like to do any image sourcing or visually creative tasks myself. This involves not just finding clipart for worksheets and presentations, but also making tables and charts look nice, planning the layout of materials, etc., which I customize based on the lesson topic and also my knowledge of my students preferences. I know that image and external file generation has definitely progressed leaps and bounds from when AI was still new, but I don't think I use AI enough to justify the cost, especially when I'm still trying to pay off my grad school debt.

AI: That's a very practical consideration - the cost-benefit analysis really matters, especially with student debt in the picture.

When you do use AI for the tasks where you find it valuable, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, refining and adjusting as you go, or do you tend to give it a comprehensive prompt and then take what it gives you to work with independently?

User: I think there's only a back and forth if I'm unsatisfied or if I think my initial instructions were too vague, so they were misinterpreted. I don't really need (or expect) a perfectly generated masterpiece from AI, and I think I'm picky anyways, so I almost always aim for a comprehensive prompts which I then use as a base to do my own work with.

AI: That's a really efficient approach - getting what you need in one go and then taking it from there with your own expertise.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your school has particular attitudes or policies around AI use?

User: I live and work in an extremely rural area, and most of my coworkers are significantly older than me, so their reactions to AI usage are usually either awe or a request for me to teach them how to use it. This might have actually influenced me to use it less, since the material preparation and other activities I see from my coworkers is still more 'old school' than anything. And I'm not restricted in any way from my AI usage, but I do mostly handle it in my preparation hours after class, so I can't say that any policies which exist would actually affect me anyways. I'm unsure of any requirements around using the digital textbook and the AI courses that come along with it, since those are all handled in the Korean teacher's lessons, not my own.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're almost in a position where you're the AI-savvy person that others come to for help, but that dynamic might actually be making you more conservative in your own usage.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Probably my greatest success with AI at work came from generating a summer-camp plan focused around the theme of recycling and saving the earth. Since it was a five day program and I had to create materials for young learners in the morning, followed by older learners in the afternoon, being able to get more than fifty ideas put together and listed out step by step, with materials, for me to them choose from and arrange was extremely convenient and satisfying. It seriously reduced my workload a lot, at least in terms of sourcing ideas for a last-minute programs. I don't have too many experiences of being frustrated, but I think every one of them came with trying to provide translations in Korean of something, because a lot of Korean includes their emotions/opinions built into the grammar instead of just being directly expressed, and certain sentences with the same functional meaning can come off entirely improper or awkward in tone just from the wrong grammar expressing reason or order of events being used.

AI: That summer camp example sounds like a perfect use case - getting that breadth of organized ideas to choose from must have been such a time-saver for a last-minute program.

The translation frustration you mentioned is really interesting too. It sounds like you've experienced firsthand how AI can miss those subtle cultural and grammatical nuances that are so important in Korean.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think your usage patterns might change as the technology develops or as your circumstances change?

User: I imagine that as the cross-language usage becomes less risky, I'll probably have more use for it in things like creating flashcards or mind-maps that include both English and whatever first language my students at that time have, but probably my attitude towards just generating base materials and then working on them myself will stay the same. Maybe I'll use it more if I ever pay off my debts and then buy a premium subscription finally.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the differences between ESL and EFL learners, and how that affects the appropriateness of AI-generated materials - that's such an important nuance that I hadn't considered before.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, I think this is about it. Thanks for the in-depth interview.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a starting point for material creation, the importance of cultural context in education, and how rural workplace dynamics can influence AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your workflow and share those specific examples. Take care!
