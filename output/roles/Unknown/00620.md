Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good no questions before we begin, go ahead

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: the main role of AI in my typical work day is that of an assistant, proofreader, help with finding/ confirming  patterns in data and help finding specific information where a regular web search would be too time consuming.

AI: That's helpful context. You mentioned using AI to find patterns in data - could you walk me through what that looks like for you? What kind of data are you typically working with, and how does the AI help you spot those patterns?

User: i work with different kinds of data, an example would be the analysis of how interaction with clients affects donation rate and frequency.  There are a lot of  parameters that need to be kept in mind that can create different scenarios, like events clients are invited to, what kind of events, were guests allowed, was travel involved, and what kind of activities were better liked and much more. All this information from previous years on different group sets is generally analysed to tailor new strategies  and AI is quite helpful for me as it helps recognise some patterns or things I might have missed, or gives me new inputs to look at things from different perspectives

AI: That sounds like really complex analysis work. When you're working through all those parameters - the events, guest policies, travel, client preferences - how do you typically interact with the AI? Are you more likely to work through the analysis together step-by-step, or do you tend to give it a complete dataset and ask it to identify patterns on its own?

User: It depends on the depth of analysis I need. Sometimes, if I already recognise certain patterns that are working and seem good, I will just ask the AI to confirm them for me, sharing a tailored version of the data. In some other instances, when trying to find something different, I might approach giving a full dataset and get the AI to identify the patterns and then work together from there

AI: That's really interesting how you adjust your approach based on what you're trying to accomplish. You mentioned sometimes sharing a "tailored version of the data" when you want confirmation. What goes into that decision of how much data to share or hold back when working with AI?

User: i have noticed that if i give too much information that is not needed it can sway the attention of the AI on less important aspects, so rather than having to go trhough analysys that keep into account things i might not be interested in i kind of do the skimming myself, like an example could be if i am doing an analysys on attendence of events that require travelling or not require travelling and that is my main focus depending on what information i am trying to find i will give the AI only what is needed. Is it a specific place that people seem not to want to travel to? Is it the time of the year? Are there other events somewhere else that could affect attendance? i will include all the above in my data however, lets say i have a section of clients' event feedback,  i will look at the feedback and include only the pertinent ones as sometimes they might not be related to the specific events and they would skew the results if not correctly categorised, which i feel is something AI sometimes still struggles with.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach to data curation. You mentioned that AI sometimes still struggles with correctly categorizing feedback - can you tell me more about what you've observed there? What happens when the categorization goes wrong, and how do you catch those issues?

User: Sometimes it could just reference something odd that to me doesn't make sense, and upon review of the data, i can see why such an assumption was made. some feedbacks can be really generic and they might not have anything to do with the event itself but because they were inputted undet the event feedback they get taken as that while especially with this sort of data there has to be a different kind of analysys, like a few  feedbacks refer to the  terrible food of the event, the report and analysys references that however the event that had that feedback actually didnt have any food. so generally i would filter them out to avoid any mistakes

AI: That's a perfect example of why your filtering approach makes sense. When you catch those kinds of mismatches - like the food complaints for an event with no food - how does that discovery process usually unfold? Do you spot these issues while reviewing the AI's analysis, or do you have other ways of catching them?

User: i generally try and filter them myself, or if i notice a pattern i will make the AI clear the feedbacks we dont need before proceeding with the analysis,

AI: That makes a lot of sense. Shifting gears a bit - you mentioned at the start that AI also helps you as an assistant and proofreader, and with finding specific information when web searches would be too time consuming. Are there certain work tasks where you deliberately choose not to use AI, even though it could potentially help? What makes you decide to handle something yourself instead?

User: the main thing that stops me from using Ai is if i am using sensitive information, as sometimes i could create mock data to run the analysys anyway but other times it is easier for me to do the whole anlaysis and then just use the Ai in the parts withotut the sensitive data.

AI: That's a really important consideration around sensitive data. Besides that privacy aspect, are there other types of tasks where you prefer to keep things in your own hands? Maybe tasks where you feel like doing it yourself gives you something that AI assistance wouldn't?

User: There isn't any task specifically i prefer to keep in my hands, in my case, i think AI can handle what i ask in a good way. for me it is just a matter of time mainly if i think i can permorm the task easily myself i will just do it, like certain emails i will type myslef becasue by the time i ask the AI what i need i might as well just haave typed the email, in other instanses if i think i want to add something that the ai could extrapolate better in less time than me and have the email done faster i will just use it

AI: That's a practical way to think about it - weighing the time it takes to set up the AI versus just doing it yourself. When you do use AI for work tasks, how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you approach it? Do you find that your team has particular attitudes or practices around AI use?

User: i dont think many people are open about their use of AI, I think in some cases there is a stigma around it still. in my personal opinion the issue is the lack of information and lack of knowledge on how to use Ai to its potential. A lot of people see the use of AI as a cheat or lazy sort of approach instead of understanding that it is an aid to improve the workload

AI: That perspective about the stigma is really insightful. Given that environment where people aren't very open about AI use, how does that affect your own approach? Do you find yourself being discrete about when and how you use it, or has it influenced your workflow in other ways?

User: i don't think it has changed my approach, i do find myself sometimes being discreet about it, but mainly because i don't want it to come across as if the Ai is doing everything, as i feel a lot of people might think that if you use AI  you arent doing the work youself when actually sometimes it could be more challenging set up the AI correclty to get a better result. My workflow is good and regular the AI has helped especially during busy times where the workflow is higher and the time is still the same to complete more tasks

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: once i was trying to sort an excel data set and i needed some help with some formulas to put into it and  it felt like at a loss as i couldn't get the information i needed back, i kept having a lot of different responses none of which i needed. it was kind of frustrating as i couldn't understand how to explain my need correctly and kept creating misunderstandings

AI: That sounds really frustrating. What happened in that situation? Did you eventually find a way to get the help you needed, or did you end up solving it differently?

User: i did have to rely on the old approach of findind the infomation myself and then use the AI to implement the information the way i needed it. it would have been great if i could have saved myself all the frustration of looking into it as it was really complex to figure out

AI: That's a really illuminating example - it sounds like finding the right way to communicate your specific need was the real challenge there. 

As we start to wrap up, I'm curious about one more thing: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: i am not worried about AI taking over, i feel like i keep improving my skills anyway and i have the capability to work alongside of AI, i see AI as a great helping tool which is bound to make a lot of things easier but i do strongly believe that it is important to have people alongised that are capable to understand and use it correctly, you know we all get things wrong sometimes even AI

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on the human-AI partnership. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future?

User: i do think my relationship with AI at work is evolving as AI progresses and new functions are brought out i can use it for new different things

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you strategically filter data to help AI focus on what's most relevant, and your view of AI as a collaborative tool rather than something to fear.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. Have a great rest of your day!
