Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I am ready.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I will typically use AI to aid in researching information about outdoor clothing and equipment to provide to customers. While I may not use it everyday, sometimes it is useful to learn more details/facts about a specific product in order to advice customers better.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a research tool to better serve your customers in outdoor gear. 

Tell me more about that process. When you're looking up details about a specific product, what does that interaction typically look like?

User: For example, I wanted to learn more/find out more about different types of running shoes for our running department so I asked AI to summarise the different ways neutral and stability running shoes are designed.

AI: That sounds like a practical way to quickly get up to speed on product categories. 

When you got that summary about neutral versus stability running shoes, how did you end up using that information? Did it change how you approached conversations with customers about running shoes?

User: The information was formatted in a concise way which consolidated the key knowledge I would need to communicate to customers. This helped to make sure i'm informing the customers the right information in a productive way.

AI: That makes sense - having that consolidated knowledge at your fingertips. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of helping customers that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with those tasks? What makes those different for you?

User: So, most of the time I would be able to help customers perfectly fine, but using AI alongside my own expertise helps to affirm the knowledge I already know and possibly learn a new fact that I can use to sell a product. I'm using AI as more of an assistant if that makes sense.

AI: That does make sense - using AI more as a backup to confirm what you already know and occasionally pick up something new. 

When you do use AI for that product research, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing conversation with it about a topic, or do you tend to ask it for specific information and then take that away to use on your own?

User: I tend to ask for specific information about a particular topic I may not be as comfortable approaching customers about.

AI: So you're targeting those knowledge gaps where you want to feel more confident before talking with customers.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others at your store use it similarly, or is it something you've adopted on your own?

User: I think i'm probably one of the few to use it to help with my role but I think my manager may use it as well for planning meetings and stuff like that.

AI: Interesting that you've kind of pioneered this approach for customer service while your manager uses it for different tasks.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It's never made me frustrated but it is always quite useful to summarise particular concepts that my works own training covered in a different way that I wasn't as happy with.

AI: That's a great point - getting that alternative explanation when the company training didn't quite click for you.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Well, I can imagine in the future, in person stores with customer advisors like my role will be less and less useful as more people will go online or ask AI for help and advice about the products.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective about the future of retail. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as time goes on?

User: I will probably use it in the same way as there is not much more scope in my position to use it any differently.

AI: That makes sense given your specific role. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience using AI as a research assistant to fill knowledge gaps and support your customer interactions. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you get alternative explanations when company training doesn't quite land the same way.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: All good, thank you

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a targeted research tool to build confidence in customer interactions, and your thoughts on the future of retail, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
