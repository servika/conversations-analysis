Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I have no questions!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: The biggest utility is using it for capturing meeting notes, summarising those meeting notes (and creating an agenda), and then drafting communication to stakeholders and my team. Being in project delivery means that AI can take on the bulk of the repetitive and mundane tasks, while I can then focus more on managing people.

AI: That's really helpful context. You mentioned that AI handles the repetitive and mundane tasks while you focus on managing people. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There isn't anything that doesn't go past my eyes, so in that sense there is nothing that is solely dedicated to AI. I am happy to run basically any task through a model as long as I know that i have the time to give it a thorough check. I probably wouldn't let AI handle any critical communication with stakeholders, however I am yet to have a scenario which would require that.

AI: That's interesting - you have that thorough review process for everything. You mentioned you wouldn't let AI handle critical stakeholder communication, but haven't faced that scenario yet.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: So for capturing meeting notes, there is not a lot I can do while that is ongoing (since I am in the meeting). So for automated tasks like that then it is completely delegates, but I will check the notes afterwards for accuracy. Other tasks, like creating an agenda, or stakeholder communication, I will go back and forth with the model until I get the desired results. It usually only takes a couple tries since I have done this so frequently.

AI: That makes sense - different tasks call for different approaches. The meeting notes are more of a complete delegation since you're occupied, while things like agendas and communications are more collaborative.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: We work in tech/telecomms so there is a great push for the adoption of AI internally since the company wants to be on the cutting edge of AI implementation. Everyone is using it for meeting notes/transcripts and drafting communications since it saves so much time. I am unsure how it is implemented for the management above me and also the technical staff working behind the scenes, but I would not be surprised if they are also heavily relying on AI.

AI: That tech/telecomms environment sounds very supportive of AI adoption. It's interesting that there's that company-wide push and you can see similar usage patterns among your peers.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The occasions it is frustrating is when the model just can't quite understand what is going on in a meeting. Often there is 12+ people in a meeting and if individuals end up speaking over each other, or someone isn't being disciplined with muting their microphone and we get too much background noise (some employees work near the call centre and so you can often hear their chatter in the background), the meeting notes can be a mess. It's not a critical failure or anything, but it's certainly time I wish I didn't have to spend cleaning it up.

AI: That's a really concrete example - those chaotic meetings with multiple people talking over each other and background noise from the call center definitely sound like they'd trip up the transcription. The cleanup time probably defeats some of the efficiency gains you're looking for.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think it is just a case of, those who adopt AI into their workflow will be okay. At the end of the day, there will always need to be someone who looks after other people and essentially that is what I fundamentally do as a PM. Even if AI takes over every aspect of my workflow, I will still need to be there to make sure it's working as intended and checking in on people.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - focusing on that human element of looking after people and ensuring things work as intended. It sounds like you see your core value as being in that oversight and people management role.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can only seeing its influence growing. Assuming innovation will only grow, I don't see a reason why AI wouldn't take over most aspects of my workflow. But again, I think that will only free me to have more time to do what matters, which is my communication with various stakeholders.

AI: That's fascinating - you see AI potentially taking over most workflow aspects but view that as liberating you to focus more on stakeholder communication, which seems to be what you find most valuable.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI adoption frees you up for the human-centered aspects of project management.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't believe so no. Thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI integrates into project management workflows, especially that balance between delegation and collaboration, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
