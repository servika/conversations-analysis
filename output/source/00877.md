Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds good to me. Let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I ask for help in research first, I like to have workspaces for projects I work on, and then I ask a lot of research based questions first

AI: Tell me more about these workspaces for projects. How do you set those up and use them with AI?

User: I currently favour using perplexity.ai pro account, I like its flexabity, and that is where I set up workspaces and use the research features

AI: That's interesting that you use Perplexity rather than Claude for your research work. What draws you to Perplexity's approach over other AI tools? What specific features make it work better for your research workflow?

User: Well the interface is better, I like being able to choose which AI API is used, it has a choice, and I like the results it gives, as it easy to copy and paste from. Overall I use perplexity more as it is easy to organise and search previous work

AI: What kinds of research questions do you typically ask when you're starting a new project? Can you walk me through what that initial research phase looks like for you?

User: OK, so I have a new project this month, a client has a new website, based in Ireland, and is selling irish language diaries. So I start with building a client time sheet, to clock time spent, then I would make a new workspace just for this client, then the first thing i would do is ask for a first 6 month website plan, which would include marketing plan and ecommerce plan and advertising and social media plan. 
I would ask for a timeline to be built as a gannt chart and use the results to make my own document in Google Sheets and Google Docs. So i copy and paste what I want and leave what I dont want behind.

AI: That sounds like a really structured approach. When you're copying and pasting from the AI's results into your own Google Sheets and Docs, what determines what you keep versus what you leave behind? What makes certain suggestions more valuable to you than others?

User: Not all the content generated by the AI is what I want to use. I simply dont copy anything that I dont think fits what I want to use.

AI: Can you give me an example of something the AI might suggest in one of those plans that you'd decide not to use? What doesn't fit for you?

User: Like when making a business plan of sales, and it forecast sales of 300 diaries in the first month, thats just not accurate

AI: That's a really good example - the AI being overly optimistic about sales projections. When you encounter suggestions like that, do you just skip them entirely, or do you ever go back to the AI to ask it to revise its approach or give you more realistic numbers?

User: skip,  rarely do I find correcting an AI is worth the time or effort

AI: That's fascinating - you prefer to just take what's useful rather than spend time refining the AI's output. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I dont think AI is very good at new ideas. Like really unique ones. At this time, it is not possible.

AI: What do you mean by "really unique" ideas? Can you describe a situation where you needed that kind of creativity that AI just couldn't deliver?

User: Mostly in and around creativity and art

AI: Can you walk me through a specific creative challenge you faced recently where you knew AI wouldn't be able to help? What did that process look like when you had to tackle it on your own?

User: I don't think an AI can write an galeic calendar or diary in correct Irish, it would not be suitble for print. Also it not a useful as working with human illustrator. AI art is very poor, and is also very hard to correct and work in collobaration with. At this time, human artists are easier and better to work with in the creative industries

AI: That makes a lot sense, especially with the Irish language component - accuracy would be critical for something going to print. When you do work with human illustrators, how does that collaboration process differ from your interactions with AI? What makes the human collaboration work better for you?

User: Being able to just simply say to a person, move the logo down a bit, so it doesnt clip the other text, and maybe then can we add some lens flare behind the person and then fix the colour to be more 80s.

AI: That kind of iterative feedback loop sounds really valuable - where you can have that back-and-forth refinement. When you use AI for the research and planning tasks, how does your typical interaction pattern work? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to ask for something complete and then just take what you need from it?

User: I find that collobration starts on early, but then at a point it becomes more directed by myself, focusing in on some details, asking for rewrites to add or remove emphasis or content.

AI: Can you describe what triggers that shift for you? What's happening when you move from that early collaboration phase to taking more control and giving specific directions?

User: When the "bones" of the content is written to fill each catergory that I consider important. Build the framework, then go back and edit each section or refine.

AI: So once the AI helps you establish that framework with all the important categories filled in, you switch to being more directive about the details. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I end up sending more things to share with them. I make it clear the content is by AI, that I have editied and that I would like feedback on how it scans and edits that should be made

AI: It sounds like AI has actually increased your sharing and collaboration with colleagues. How do they typically respond when you tell them the content started with AI? Are they comfortable with that approach?

User: AI is here, its like a word proccessor, its a day to day tool now, and if people have issues with it, they need to realise the genie is not going back into the bottle, and start utlising it in way that improves the quality of thier lives

AI: That's a pragmatic perspective - treating it like any other productivity tool. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There would be more frustration really, I think the limitations are that it cant be trusted. Today, I would not trust an AI LLM service with a bus timtable. They are just not trustworthy for vital things. I would always check on the offical bus or train website. AI content is very much fallable. And this worries me more than anything else, that people are trusting the results and building on wrong data.

AI: That concern about reliability is really important. When you're using AI for research and planning, how do you handle that trust issue? Do you have specific ways you verify the information before you use it with clients?

User: I would verify each and every statement of truth made myself. I would ask for links to the evidence and if it can not produce links I dont use the content

AI: That's a rigorous approach - requiring links as evidence before using any claims. Given these trust concerns, how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I fine with the loss of skills... I have been working on digital projects since 1996, most of my skills have become obsolete, byt the knowledge they have given is not. You dont lose knowledge, just the skills become extinct.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction between skills and knowledge. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: AI will be across all digital devices and content. Headphones will have cameras, and AI will whisper to you about what it sees... It is going to be everywhere, on everything, gathering data, explaining things

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on verifying AI content with actual links and your pragmatic view of AI as just another tool like a word processor - but one that requires careful verification.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I want to say I am optimistic about AI and humans. I think this AI chatbot evolution is the very beginning of much more intelligence, but also much more energy needed. I truly hope that an AI can become truly creative and inventive, beautiful and beyond benign, a benefit for us all.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing that hopeful vision - it's a beautiful way to end our conversation. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI today while maintaining optimism for its creative potential have been incredibly valuable.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your perspective on everything from verification workflows to the evolution of skills will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
