Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: All good.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a nail tech and I use it for creating captions for posts on socials and helping with pricing lists.

AI: That's interesting - using AI for the business and marketing side of your nail tech work. 

When you're creating those social media captions, can you walk me through what that process looks like for you? How do you typically work with AI to get the captions you want?

User: I collaborate with the AI, for example, I'll send a pic of my work and explain what service I completed and ask it to create a relevant caption.

AI: That sounds like a really collaborative approach - you're providing the context and expertise about your work, and the AI helps with the writing piece.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your nail tech business that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I tend to edit the caption after the AI has done its bit as it normally sounds a bit fake, so I edit it myself to give it more of a "human" touch.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about adding that human touch back in. It sounds like you've found a balance where AI gives you a starting point, but your editing is what makes it authentically yours.

Are there other aspects of your nail tech business - beyond the social media captions - where you prefer to keep things completely in your own hands? What drives those choices for you?

User: I wouldn't like an AI to respond to comments on socials for me, again because of the human aspect.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining that personal connection with your clients through direct interaction.

When you do use AI for work tasks like those captions or pricing lists, can you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you usually going back and forth with it to refine things, or do you tend to give it all the information upfront and then work with what it gives you?

User: I tend to go back and forth with the AI, each time asking it to amend a detail or to change the style of the caption slightly. We usually go back and forth around 5-6 times.

AI: That's a really detailed collaboration process - it sounds like you're actively shaping the output through multiple rounds of feedback.

How have your colleagues or others in the nail tech industry influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you talked with other nail techs about using these tools, or has your workplace culture shaped how you approach it?

User: Most of my colleagues use AI for the same reasons. We are not content creators by choice, but the industry now demands content creation due to the visual aspect of the industry and this is how to attract clients in this day and age.

AI: That's such an important point - how the industry itself has shifted to require skills that weren't traditionally part of being a nail technician. It sounds like AI has become almost a necessity to meet these new demands.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was struggling on canva to create my price list and as a last resort I provided all my pricings/services to an AI and included my style, colour pallet and branding information and it made an excellent price list for me (to my surprise).

AI: That sounds like it was a real breakthrough moment - going from struggling with the design tools to having something that worked well for your business.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially with things like content creation becoming such a big part of your work?

User: I think Ai would not be able to completely take over the role as people like a human touch, and alot of people see their nail appointments as a kind of therapy session.

AI: That's such a valuable perspective - recognizing that the core human connection in your work can't be replicated. The therapeutic aspect you mention seems really important to what makes your service unique.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it for different things, or changing how you work with it?

User: Not at the moment, but I'm sure as time goes on there will be alot more I could use AI to help me with to allow me to concentrate of the core of my business (creating beautiful nails).

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to think about it - using AI to handle the supporting tasks so you can focus on what you do best.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about how AI fits into your work as a nail tech. I particularly found your point about the industry demanding content creation skills fascinating - how AI is helping bridge that gap between being a skilled technician and meeting modern marketing expectations.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI to support the business side while maintaining that essential human connection in your core service will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
