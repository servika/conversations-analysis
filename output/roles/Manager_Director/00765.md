Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That's all good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in payments product management for a fin tech and before that for a bank.  The most use I get out of AI is for summarising long, technical documents.  These are typically about new emerging standards or regulations and I want to get a feel for the main points that they cover.  This is sometimes for my own interest but often because I want to use summaries to help inform my bosses and others who will be impacted.  Change happens fairly slowly in the world of regulation but we need to be planning ahead so getting high-level views of what's coming in fron of people is important to do at an early stage.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're working with these regulatory documents, could you walk me through what that process looks like? Do you typically read through the document first yourself, or do you go straight to AI for the initial summary?

User: I will typically scan the exec summary and the contents page and if there's an overall timeline section, I'll look at that - but I'll fairly quickly use AI for the summary.  I will cross-check the summary with the source document before using it.  There are other tasks I do use AI for as well but this is probably the one that saves me the most time.

AI: That cross-checking step you mentioned is interesting. What are you typically looking for when you verify the AI summary against the source document?

User: I won't necessarily check everything but I might pick out some key parts of the summary and make sure that they're an accurate reflection of the source.  So as an example, if the summary says that the date when the new regulation comes into effect is June 1 2026, I'll double check that and maybe a couple of other key facts to make sure things are being carried across correctly.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - focusing on those critical details like dates and key facts. You mentioned there are other tasks you use AI for as well. What are some of those other areas where you find it helpful?

User: In my role I produce a lot of papers - business cases, analytical pieces, thought leadership pieces for customers - I have found it helpful to use AI to run these through to check for ways in which they might be improved.  I'm not looking for spell checking as that will happen as I go along but it is sometimes helpful for ways to make the output sharper or I'll ask for a specific focus on the conclusion or action steps.

AI: That's a really interesting use case - using AI as a kind of editor or reviewer for your writing. When AI suggests ways to make your papers "sharper" or improve conclusions, how do you decide which suggestions to take and which to leave?

User: Experience I guess.  I'll review what is proposed and judge whether I think it fits and enhances the work.  It has to still sound like it's in my "voice" and not something shoved in that appears out of context.

AI: That "voice" consideration is fascinating. It sounds like maintaining authenticity in your writing is really important to you. Are there certain types of tasks you prefer to handle entirely yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I've never used AI to help with emails or with writing performance review content.  The former is because I don't typically write long emails and I'm quite informal and I'm not sure it would save time and the latter because it just feels like the kind of thing I ought to do myself!

AI: That's a great point about performance reviews - there seems to be something about the personal nature of that task that feels important to handle yourself. When you are using AI for those document summaries or paper reviews, would you describe your approach as more collaborative - going back and forth with AI throughout the process - or do you tend to give it a complete task and let it work independently?

User: Document summaries I tend to let it work independently.  Reviews of papers is a bit more of a collaborative process.

AI: What makes the paper review process feel more collaborative for you? How does that back-and-forth typically unfold?

User: I'll give it a first go, review the proposals and may come back saying - drop that one, have another go at that section, punch up the conclusion to be more definitive, reduce the action points from 10 to 6 - that kind of thing.  It's the kind of thing I would once have done by printing out a paper copy and annotating as I review it.

AI: That's a really vivid comparison - replacing the printed copy and annotations with this iterative AI process. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people openly discuss their AI usage, or is it more of an individual choice?

User: It's discussed a lot and there are a couple of people focused on how we can use AI more.  I've obviously followed their work and I know I get output that is AI produced - for instance summaries of news stories impacting on our work areas.  The big area that has changed is how our project and development teams work - I work with them so see some of it but don't directly use the tools myself.

AI: It sounds like AI is becoming quite integrated across different functions at your company. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The satisfied ways I use it are the ones I've described to you - they don't always work first time but it's generally helpful.  More frustrating is when I used AI to try and find out a specific piece of information.  I might want to look back to when a new product was introduced, or new legislation came into effect - I've found AI to be less reliable in these instances with a straightforward web search often being just as good.  This may be because the subject matter can sometimes be quite specialist.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - AI working well for processing information you already have versus being less reliable for finding specific factual information. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do a bit.  I've always enjoyed the research and analysis side of my role and the writing so I'm mindful of not wanting to hand that over.  With that said, I'm aware of the time that can be saved and that AI can have a role in doing some of the foundational work leaving me to do the more interesting side.  I'm also at a later stage in my career so it's something I might have to worry about a bit less than others.

AI: That's such a thoughtful perspective - using AI to handle the foundational work so you can focus on the more interesting analytical and strategic aspects. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm sure it will but it's hard to know precisely how.  One area where I hope it will is in improving some of our product development processes - automating coding and testing and improving accuracy and consistency so our product development cycles can be sped up.  If it means we can do things more quickly and cheaply then we can get more done and release more interesting stuff.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI for the foundational work while keeping the more analytical and strategic thinking for yourself - that balance seems really deliberate and well-considered.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: One final thing I'd add is that I know colleagues value what AI can do but they like to have choice.  Having AI embedded is not something I think everyone is comfortable with so having the option to disable tools for certain activities is important.

AI: That's a really valuable insight about the importance of choice and control over when and how AI is used. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your perspectives on balancing efficiency with maintaining your core analytical skills, the importance of verification processes, and especially that point about colleagues needing the option to opt out - these insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: No problem. Thanks

AI: Thank you so much! Have a great rest of your day.
