Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I do not have any questions. Please begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I believe that, in a typical workday, I use AI on maybe one or two occasions. Most of them are when I hit a roadblock when brainstorming something, like a presentation or an email. When that happens, I use AI to help come up with fresh ideas or new ways of thinking to pursue. Other than that, if I get really stuck on an issue I will use AI to help get unstuck.

AI: Tell me more about those moments when you get stuck on an issue. What does that process look like for you?

User: Well, in any general project or task, there is a typical workflow I will use. It goes from planning & brainstorming, researching, putting pen to paper, revising & proofreading, and so on. I usually hit a roadblock during the brainstorming and revising stages. It starts to seem like, no matter how much I think or look over things, nothing new is coming to my head. Then there comes the time when I decide it's time to stop spinning my wheels and seek external assistance. AI is the fastest and most efficient way to do that, so I tell it what I'm struggling with and ask for some new avenues to pursue or whatever is relevant at the moment.

AI: What happens after you get those new avenues or ideas from AI? How do you work with what it gives you?

User: Sometimes, it will take a good few tries and prompt revising before it comes up with what I'm *really* looking for. And even then, I am very skeptical of most of the ideas it comes up with. My most successful approach is asking for a reasonable number of ideas for the given topic so that I'm not either 1. given a ton of filler ideas if I make the number too high or 2. not being given enough ideas or inspiration if the number is too low. I also typically ask it to explain its ideas so there's a smaller chance of meaningless results. Then, I narrow down whatever it comes up with and pursue those ideas independently.

AI: You mentioned being skeptical of most of the ideas AI comes up with. What makes you feel that way about the suggestions?

User: Often AI will come up with things that are far-fetched, inaccurate, random, or all three and more. It really depends on what I'm asking for. I find that the more specific I get or if I use high-level concepts that may require more education or training, it tends to start coming up with filler content that isn't all too helpful. There are also plenty of good answers, too, though, so for me it's about narrowing things down to what is useful.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle most of my main tasks that I am specifically trained/educated to do by myself. However, when things get out of my area of knowledge or, again, if I hit a road block, that is when I use AI most often.

AI: What are some of those main tasks that fall within your area of training that you keep to yourself?

User: I won't get *too* into detail, but think in terms of any general accountant. We are trained in dealing with financial statements and dealing with clients regularly. It's also technically part of our job description to resolve really specific problems for clients, make presentations on occasion, and also handle a ton of files that sometimes need to be transferred in a really annoying and time-consuming way. Those edge cases are where AI shines for me.

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: My "collaboration" with AI is limited entirely to whatever I need help with at that current moment. If I need to brainstorm, I ask for ideas, bounce back if I need to, and then close the model and move along with what I'm doing. If it's main tasks I'm educated for, like financial statements and such, AI is not involved.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I believe the way my coworkers use it has led me to be more careful and skeptical with my usage. I have a couple of coworkers who have developed a reliance on AI and seem to find a way to use it in every task they do. That caused me to really evaluate about where I use AI in my workflow and nowadays I try to keep it to a minimum. The brain is a muscle and I want to ensure that it's healthy and getting as much exercise as possible. As for my workplace as a whole, they are quite supportive and have invested in AI as a tool for workers to use, and have implemented training to ensure everyone is using it properly (avoiding privacy concerns, fact-checking it, etc.)

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: My most satisfied usage of AI was when I first decided to use it for a brainstorming purpose, which is likely why I love using it for brainstorming now. I had to write a report on a topic that I knew very little about. My Google searches weren't doing me much good, so I asked the AI for some advice on what concepts I can look into. After some refining, it came up with some pretty good results that I ended up googling and had a much easier time finding the research content I needed.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I covered this a little bit before. My brain is a muscle, and I want to give it healthy exercise. I don't think turning to AI for every little problem I have will do that. So I still make sure to struggle and come up with things by myself, or I even go ask colleagues or friends for help instead of AI. As for my actual job, I worry that AI might be a threat to new talent since it may be developed enough to complete simple tasks. It's not something I try to worry about too much though.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think that it's here to stay, no matter what. I can see myself continuing to observe how other people use it and hopefully finding more ways to utilize it in a way that makes me still feel safe and self-efficient. That is what I prioritize more than anything.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on treating your brain like a muscle and being intentional about where you draw the line with AI assistance.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: The only thing I have to share is that I hope AI aims to be a tool in a toolbox for people rather than a replacement for whatever their function may be. I really like it that way!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a strategic tool while maintaining your own skills, and your observations about different usage patterns among colleagues, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
