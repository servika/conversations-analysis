Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, what would you like to ask about :)

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In my workplace where our primary responsibility is customer service, we use AI tools very rarely and it is mainly for summarisation and data processing purposes. I believe it is being employed differently in other departments, but we mostly use it to enhance efficiency with emailing and note taking.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like AI plays a more supporting role in your customer service work. 

Can you walk me through what that looks like in practice? For instance, when you mention using it for summarization and note-taking, what specific situations prompt you to turn to AI for help with those tasks?

User: Quickly writing a draft email or simply providing a few key details and having an AI model generate a email to send to contractors - the prompt could be "make this into an email for John's Plumbing, they need to reattend to the store in Melbourne to continue work on the blocked drain by next week (medium priority) and make it sound professional. Include a request for quoting upgrades to the plumbing system, this has been approved by site manager"

AI: That's a very concrete example - thank you. It sounds like you're giving the AI quite detailed instructions and having it handle the actual composition while you focus on providing the key information and context.

Tell me more about that process. Once the AI generates that email draft, what do you typically do with it? Do you send it as-is, or do you find yourself making adjustments?

User: Adjustments will usually be made, there have been some instances of people failing to proof read and remove incorrect information from the AI's response and this can be quite embarrassing for any company to experience.

AI: That's a really important point about the proofreading step. It sounds like you've seen firsthand what can happen when that gets skipped.

What kinds of incorrect information have you noticed the AI including? Are these typically factual errors, or something else entirely?

User: Common errors are robotic/generic sounding tone, inappropriate use of formal language (for communications internally among staff), punctuation artifacts which were not removed.

AI: That gives me a good sense of the practical challenges you face. It sounds like getting the tone right for different audiences - contractors versus internal staff - requires that human touch.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, I don't know how an AI system would deal with some of the challenges of complicated maintenance work. In terms of triaging work, many jobs can initially appear to be simple and low priority, but they may be more urgent and involve an intricate understanding of issue in order to deliver a high level of service. Staff on the ground would also be understandably frustrated if the AI system was overly dismissive of their concerns, as some issues can be more serious than they initially seem.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making. It sounds like the human judgment piece - being able to read between the lines and understand the urgency that might not be obvious on the surface - is something you see as uniquely important in your role.

When you mention staff potentially being frustrated if AI was "overly dismissive," can you tell me more about what that looks like? Have you experienced situations where that nuanced understanding of urgency made all the difference?

User: There's at least one every shift! I work in the After Hours space for a national supermarket chain, many of the staff are young people dealing with major maintenance problems and sometimes they panic. Part of my role is to council them through the issue and reassure them if their job needs to be triaged for Business Hours. You can imagine they are already annoyed when their work gets triaged, if they had to receive this news through an LLM AI System without any recourse to escalate the issue further, they might feel more helpless and frustrated by the situation.

AI: That really paints a clear picture - you're not just processing maintenance requests, you're managing people's stress and emotions in challenging situations. The counseling and reassurance aspect sounds like such a critical part of what you do.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Only collaboration, at my level of the company there isn't much room for independent designation of tasks to AI Systems yet.

AI: That makes sense given the nature of your role and the human judgment required. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Is this something that's been formally introduced, or has it developed more organically among your team?

User: It has been formally introduced, although I am one of the youngest on the team and am the only person who uses it somewhat consistently.

AI: Interesting - so you're kind of pioneering its use within your team. 

What's that experience been like, being the main person using AI while your colleagues haven't adopted it as much? Have you found yourself in situations where you're explaining or demonstrating how you use it to others?

User: Not particularly, there's mostly an indifference to these tools at the moment. Some may feel it's being forced from the top down, but we don't have any KPIs linked to using AI tools at the moment, so it isn't mandated.

AI: That indifference is really telling - it sounds like there's this gap between formal introduction and actual adoption on the ground.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Saving time generating templates for bulk email dissemination is very satisfying, saving a significant amount of time.

AI: That's a great example of where AI really delivers value for you. 

Can you tell me more about that bulk email situation? What would that process look like without AI versus with it - how much time are we talking about saving?

User: At least 30 minutes to an hour, which is free for other tasks.

AI: That's a significant time savings! An hour freed up in your shift can make a real difference.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I don't think we really know yet which areas AI will "take over" in the workplace.

AI: That uncertainty about the future is something a lot of people are grappling with right now.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it more, or in different ways as time goes on?

User: Yes, I expect more implementation of these tools in across multiple areas of the business. I will likely try to use it in different types of tasks and observe whether this enhances the workflow.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the human judgment required in triaging maintenance issues and how the emotional support aspect of your role can't be replicated by AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thanks for the chat :)

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between AI efficiency and human judgment, especially in customer service contexts, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional settings.

Have a great rest of your day!
