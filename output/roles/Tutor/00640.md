Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

If you're ready, I'd love to start by hearing about how AI fits into your typical workday. What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have two jobs. I do pet care and dog walking and I also tutor middle schoolers and high schools mostly in science. For pet care, I often use AI to help me draft advertisements for my services. I also use it sometimes to make sure my messages to clients come across right. For tutoring, I sometimes use it to help me explain basic concepts (like come up with analogies) or to make quizzes or other fun activities.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI across two quite different types of work. It sounds like you've found some specific ways it helps you communicate better with clients and create educational content.

When you mention using AI to make sure your messages to clients come across right, can you tell me more about what that looks like? What kind of help are you looking for when you do that?

User: So like, sometimes I come across as too dry or too all over the place. So let's say I'm messaging a new client. I need to tell them: "So I can do Saturdays after 2pm-7pm. 30 min walk is 30 bucks plus  7 per additional dog. u have 3 dogs so its 45. what time do u want me to walk them? or do you want a 45 minutes walk or 60 minutes. 45 is 40 plus addition dog fee and 60 is 50 plus additional dog fee goes down to 5." I'd ask the AI to rewrite it. Make it more polished but also fun. make it more readable. break down the prices into a list or other format to make it more readable

AI: That makes a lot of sense - pricing structures can get confusing when you're trying to explain them in a text message. So when you hand that message over to AI to rewrite, what happens next? Do you typically use what it gives you as-is, or do you make changes to it before sending?

User: I usually dumb it down a little. make it look like I didn't use AI. Lol!

AI: Ha! That's actually really telling. What makes you want to make it look like you didn't use AI? What are you concerned might happen if clients could tell?

User: I worry they might think I don't care or that I'm dumb. I also often find the AI a little too perfect and want to come across as more human. I'm often dealing with people who see their pets as children and want them to feel that I will love them like they do (which I do!). Also, personally I'd feel it was rude if someone I was paying for a service was using AI to respond to me.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - it sounds like there's this balance you're striking between getting help with communication while still maintaining that personal, caring connection that's so important in pet care.

I'm curious about your tutoring work. When you use AI to help explain concepts or create activities, how does that process work differently? Are you thinking about the same kinds of concerns there, or does it feel different?

User: Very different concerns. I think in that case most parents are fine with AI if it helps their kids. I'll like ask the AI to come up with say a pop quiz about cell structures tailored to 9th grade biology level. My concerns then are more about it being accurate!

AI: That shift in concerns is really interesting - from worrying about seeming too impersonal with pet clients to focusing on accuracy with tutoring materials.

When you're checking that accuracy for the biology quizzes or explanations, what does that look like? Do you have a particular process for making sure the AI got the science right?

User: So usually I already know so I just read thru. Occasionally, I will do Google searches. Like say I'm helping a 10th grader with physics. I might double check the formula it gives to find the force. or I might not remember the what g equals at the top of my head. Also, let's say I ask for multiple choice questions. I double check to make sure that its answers are correct. Like one time, a question was something like Mom has A blood type, Dad has B blood type? And there was only supposed to be one answer that was correct but the model like forgot that without knowing the genotypes, A,B, and even O were possible answers.

AI: That genetics example is really insightful - it shows how AI can miss those nuanced details that make a big difference in science education. It sounds like your expertise becomes crucial for catching those kinds of errors.

When you think about these two different ways you use AI - the communication help for pet care versus the content creation for tutoring - do you find yourself collaborating with AI differently? Like, is your interaction style different between those two uses?

User: I feel way more casual with pet care. Like I'm mostly using it to fix my writing so I'm more informal. With tutoring, I often find myself already writing more professionally (like way better than I'm writing to you...lol!). I interact it with it in a more formal manner and often I feel like I'm more demanding.

AI: That's fascinating - so your tone with AI actually shifts based on what you're using it for. When you say you feel more demanding with the tutoring work, what does that look like? How does that demanding approach show up in how you interact with it?

User: I'll often give it very specific instructions. Like "Compare and contrast plant versus animal cells. Make sure to include the following: blah, blah, blah. Tailor it to a 9th grader that reads below their grade level. Make sure you define the following terms. Then give them 3 true/false questions based only on the table you gave them. Then come up with one open answer question whose answer can be found at this url. The question should only need 3-5 sentences".

AI: Those are really detailed, structured prompts! It sounds like you've developed a pretty systematic approach for the tutoring work. 

I'm curious about how your colleagues or the families you work with have influenced the way you use AI. Have you talked with other tutors or pet sitters about using these tools, or gotten any reactions from parents or pet owners?

User: Again, I don't mention it to pet owners. They don't really need to know about that. I tell parents that I can use AI to help come up with practice tests, quizzes, learning materials. Some parents are interested in having me guide their kids as they use the AI directly either by having the AI give them questions or using the AI to research topics they are interested in. I had one student last school year who I had to work with who needed to learn how to fact check the references and make sure that they were actually real. They had a learning disability that made it hard for them to organize their writing. So we worked together on learning how to use AI to fix their writing while still doing the work themselves.

AI: That work with the student who had organizational challenges with writing sounds really thoughtful - helping them learn to use AI as a tool while still maintaining ownership of their work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Ok, so one time I had a student really interested in mummies. I wanted the AI to rewrite an article about some mummies found in like South America for their grade level. Like keep everything in the article but dumb it way down. And this like 2 page article was cut into 2 paragraphs and written really condescending. Like instead of making it more readable, it was like "Hi child! Mummies are so cool! Here's a mummy found in Peru. Did you know mummies are human remains (people who have died) preserved over time?" And I just couldn't get it to actually rewrite the article in the way I wanted. It was either too cutesy or focused on wrong aspects of articles, or keep using outside information even though I directly said "Do not use outside information except when defining things". So that was really frustrating.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - especially when you had such a specific vision for what you needed and the AI kept missing the mark. It's like it couldn't find that middle ground between keeping the original content intact and making it age-appropriate without being condescending.

How do you think about maintaining your own skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do sometimes worry that my writing ability may get worse bc I often use AI to fix it. Like, I don't bother trying to remember punctuation rules bc AI will fix it.

AI: That's a really honest observation. It sounds like there's this tension between the convenience of having AI handle those mechanics versus potentially losing those skills yourself.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it more, differently, or in new ways as these tools develop?

User: I'd love for an AI assistant on my phone to perfectly draft texts for clients. Like I can give it a stream of thought and it can narrow it down and send exactly what I need. I'd also love for cheaper AI's for doing books (like keeping track of my money, payments I'm owed, budgeting and all that). I'd also love it if AI had more access to textbooks schools use. So I could be like make a quiz based on Intro to Bio by Guffan's Chapter 4 section 2. Utilize all the keywords in the section.

AI: Those are some really specific visions - it sounds like you've thought quite a bit about how these tools could better serve your particular work needs.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how differently you approach AI depending on whether you're using it for pet care versus tutoring - that distinction between casual communication help versus more formal, demanding content creation was really illuminating.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Sometimes I have it create ads for me with QR codes.

AI: Oh, that's interesting! Tell me more about that. How do you use those QR code ads - where do you put them and what do they link to?

User: They link to one of my websites which is basically just my contact info, prices,and client testimonials. I have a basic website for both jobs.

AI: That's a smart approach to marketing. Where are you placing these QR code ads that the AI creates for you?

User: I live in a small town so I post flyers. I'm friendly with some local business owners so they let me put flyers up in their shops.

AI: That small-town networking approach sounds perfect for building trust in your services, especially for pet care where people really need to feel comfortable with who they're trusting their pets with.

Is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I can't think of anything else.

AI: Perfect. Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you navigate the balance between using AI effectively while maintaining authentic relationships with clients - especially that distinction between how you approach it in pet care versus tutoring - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through these different use cases with me today.

User: You are very welcome. IS there anything I need to do to end this Convo?

AI: No, there's nothing special you need to do to end this conversation - you can just close the chat whenever you're ready. 

Thanks again for participating in this research interview. Your insights were really valuable!
