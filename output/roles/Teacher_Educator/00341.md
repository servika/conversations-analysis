Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, I don't have any questions right now.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a self employed tutor (and work as a teacher in school a little). In my tuition work, I use AI to create images collaboratively with students to then use a writing stimuli. It's great fun for them, makes them really invested in the writing and teaches them what is needed for images prompts. I also use it to train myself on unfamiliar topics, particularly maths where I am working with a student who is a little more advanced than my specialist age range.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you're using AI in some really creative ways with your students. 

Can you tell me more about how you use AI to train yourself on those more advanced math topics? What does that process typically look like for you?

User: When my student requests that we work on a topic I am not familiar with, I will ask AI to break it down for me. For example, finding the surface area of a cuboid and the volume of a triangular prism.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a quick way to get up to speed on topics outside your usual teaching range.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I never ask AI to help me to write emails or messages because I find it quick and easy to do this myself. I should ask AI to help me with ideas when I am stuck preparing a lesson but old habits die hard and I often just trawl through resources instead.

AI: That's really interesting - so there are some habits and preferences that keep you from using AI even when it might be helpful.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I use it collaboratively.

AI: Tell me more about that collaborative process. What does that back-and-forth typically look like when you're working together with AI?

User: I might ask how to do something, process the information, ask for examples, etc. Then I'll work through questions myself, make sure I am clear and come back if any issues arise. In terms of image generation, etc. I sometimes make two or three attempts to refine my student's request (but time is always a factor in an hour long session).

AI: That iterative approach sounds really thoughtful - especially how you process the information and work through questions yourself before coming back if needed.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I am generally a lone worker, I don't have colleagues or a workplace for my main job. Some of the home ed parents I work with are using education packages that use AI to tailor sessions to students much more effectively than standard programmes which is very useful and does influence how needed a tutor is! Within school (where I work minimally) only the computing specialist teacher is really using AI widely but this is changing slowly.

AI: That's a really unique perspective - working mostly independently but seeing how AI is starting to impact both the parents you work with and the school environment.

You mentioned that some home education parents are using AI-powered programs that tailor sessions more effectively. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'm not sure if your question links to the AI powered home ed packages? If so, it's more empowering for the parents and the students as the AI will scaffold learning in a way that only an educator can do otherwise; taking students back to key elements of learning when they struggle with later concepts. But it's great to know that children who have really struggled in school have access to this kind of effective support daily.

AI: That's a wonderful example of feeling satisfied with AI's impact - seeing it provide that kind of scaffolded support to students who really need it.

But thinking more about your own direct use of AI - like when you're learning those advanced math topics or working on image generation with students - can you think of a specific moment when that experience felt particularly satisfying or maybe frustrating?

User: Yes, I think it's having really clear examples of maths concepts and the ability to ask clarifying questions. It gives me confidence that I am not missing anything and can effectively teach the concept.

AI: That confidence boost sounds really valuable - knowing you have a reliable way to fill in knowledge gaps quickly.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am excited about the potential to work with AI in education, in whatever form that takes. Much more individualised learning in school would be revolutionary- one adult teaching 30 children is ridiculously inefficient!

AI: That's a really forward-thinking perspective on AI's potential in education.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see your role as a tutor changing in specific ways?

User: I know change is coming but I am not sure what it will look like! I foresee less demand for tuition as AI options grow in popularity, it's a much more affordable option. Perhaps more group tuition with ongoing support from AI might become popular. It will be interesting to see how things develop.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI gives you confidence when teaching advanced topics and your forward-thinking view of how AI might transform education - especially that observation about individualized learning being revolutionary compared to the traditional one-adult-to-thirty-children model.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI both for your own learning and collaboratively with students, as well as your thoughtful perspective on how the tutoring landscape might evolve, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
