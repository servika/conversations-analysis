Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I have recently finished my dissertation, [REDACTED], and I am working on publishing those chapters. Briefly, the project entailed modeling changes in functional connectivity measured via in vivo calcium imaging in epileptic mice to reflect how network topology changes during the time course of epileptogenesis after a severe, penetrative traumatic brain injury. We also looked at cortical stimulation as a treatment intervention to control epileptic seizures using both optogenetic stimulation and an FDA-approved drug called D-cycloserine, then measured treatment outcomes with continuous EEG recordings.

AI: That sounds like fascinating and complex research - the intersection of network topology, epileptogenesis, and therapeutic interventions. 

Can you walk me through what your workflow actually looked like day-to-day? From when you first had this research question about homeostatic plasticity through to having those dissertation chapters ready for publication - what were the main stages you went through?

User: When I first had this research question, my day-to-day consisted of literature review, proposal writing, and planning experimental design. When that was approved by my committee, I moved onto conducting experiments, which consisted of various neurosurgeries, in vivo calcium imaging, and EEG recording. Once the data was collected, I used MATLAB and Python to analyze changes in fluorescence in time series, as well as for digital signal processing and classification of seizure events using a support vector machine, then statistical analysis, then generation of figures. Once I had the results, I wrote everything up in the dissertation.

AI: That's a comprehensive process - from literature review all the way through data analysis with machine learning and statistical work in MATLAB and Python, then writing it all up.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI tools to help with code debugging, literature review, and editing my writing.

AI: Tell me more about how you used AI for code debugging - what did that look like in practice?

User: Since I did not have any formal training in coding, I used ChatGPT to help me identify ways to make my code "cleaner," and for instructional purposes, e.g. asking for examples of control flow, how specific functions worked, or explanations of which tools to use for digital signal processing.

AI: That's really helpful context - using it as both a coding tutor and for improving your code quality. 

For the code debugging specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use ChatGPT versus your traditional approach - like asking colleagues, searching documentation, or other methods you might have used before?

User: I didn't use ChatGPT versus a traditional approach. I used it alongside searching documentation and reading from textbooks. If I ran into a concept I didn't understand just from reading those sources, I'd use ChatGPT to go through different examples/scenarios or levels of the concept until I understood it better.

AI: That's interesting - you used it as a complement rather than a replacement. It sounds like ChatGPT helped bridge gaps when the documentation or textbooks weren't quite getting the concept across clearly enough.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the experimental design, the actual surgeries and imaging, the statistical analysis, or even the dissertation writing - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: Exactly! To answer your question about why I didn't use AI tools as much in those areas, my experience has been that I spend more time checking for errors in AI tools when applied in those domains, to the extent that it would be faster to do it myself. I have used it for writing in limited ways, e.g., asking for concrete examples or explanations regarding grammar/punctuation. The surgeries and imaging are better done "by the book" from the protocols I'm trying to reproduce or implement myself, as even small detours can throw the whole pipeline off. For statistical analysis, I have used R, Python, MATLAB, OriginPro, or JMP, which were all free through the university.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the time cost of verification outweighing the potential benefit in those critical areas. You mentioned you did use ChatGPT for some writing help with grammar and examples.

When you were using AI for code debugging and explanations, how did you verify or validate what it was telling you? How did you know when the explanations or code suggestions were reliable?

User: I would cross-reference what it was telling me with source documentation. Usually I would run the code line by line and play with it to make sure it was doing what ChatGPT was telling me it was doing.

AI: That's a smart verification approach - testing the code step by step and cross-referencing with documentation. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: Literature review! I can search databases with keywords and dates, but I spend a lot of time in the early phases finding relevant papers and taking stock of which details are important.

AI: Tell me more about that - what specifically about the literature review process would you want AI to help with? Is it the initial paper discovery, or something about processing and synthesizing what you find, or something else entirely?

User: For the literature review, I typically start by reading reviews, then look through the articles referenced in them. If an AI tool could narrow down which of those would be relevant to me, that would save a lot of time. My experience has been that AI tools are not reliably able to summarize key points from papers (at least not yet), so I don't really use them that way.

AI: That's a really specific pain point - having an AI that could intelligently filter through those reference lists to identify the most relevant papers for your particular research question, rather than having to manually sift through them all yourself.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on using AI as a complement to traditional methods, especially around the verification challenges, was particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so!

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI works best as a learning complement rather than a replacement - especially your approach of testing code line by line and cross-referencing with documentation - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. And that specific need for better literature filtering tools is something I hadn't fully appreciated before.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!

User: Thanks!

AI: You're very welcome! It was really great talking with you and learning about your research. Best of luck with getting those dissertation chapters published - that work on homeostatic plasticity and epileptogenesis sounds like it could have real impact. Take care!
