Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, lets begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: For a variety of tasks, I use AI for data analysis tasks, delegating tasks to agents for handle of repetitive daily tasks, social media content planning, image and video generation, spreadsheet work (models, tables, summaries).

AI: That's quite a range of applications. When you mention delegating tasks to agents for repetitive daily tasks, what does that look like in practice? Can you walk me through a specific example of how that works for you?

User: Sure, an example is once a week I use an agent I created to produce a brief on a selection of companies, I use finance API's and automations to create a data payload, define the role of the agent and how to score based on the data, the agent processes the data from API's, preforms research on ~10 companies and constructs a branded downloadable pdf that I distribute.

AI: That's a fascinating workflow you've built. It sounds like you've created quite a sophisticated system there. 

When you set up that agent to score companies based on the data, how much of your own judgment or criteria do you build into those instructions versus letting the agent make its own assessments?

User: I defined all of the instructions for scoring and analysis of the companies, it's a scoring system built on a blend of valuation, quality, momentum and catalyst metrics. Perhaps when creating the instructions I was offered insight into possible different weighting percentages on metrics etc by AI and sometimes that could influence weighting percentages being reviewed but the majority of the fundamentals or criteria to be judged were defined by myself.

AI: That's really interesting how you maintain control over the fundamental scoring criteria while being open to AI suggestions on the weighting. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Certain replies via email I handle myself such as extended communications, anything beyond top of funnels customers are handled personally such as nurturing warm leads and converting to sales. Getting to build rapport with clients and potential clients is rewarding and gives a break from deep work stuff so I like to keep a certain level of communication strictly human input only. Also depending on the brand/platform I will only use human content i.e not text generation help etc as people can spot AI written content pretty easily and may not be received well depending on brand identity etc.

AI: That makes a lot of sense – especially the point about building rapport and how that provides a rewarding break from deep work. 

When you do use AI for work tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It depends, if something is mundane, standardisable, repeatable I will delegate it, i.e the company brief I mentioned. Then I also may need to collaborate on tasks such as drafting for content, copy, visual generations as these require back and forth, reiterations etc. I also may provide context on an issue and have a conversation to derive a solution, for example a business that needs social media content creation, I will provide context on that business to an AI and create and refine a brand identity for it alongside AI, as it helps spit ball ideas and brainstorm etc. Some collaboration could be organising my works task priorities by using voice mode with an AI and discussing current projects and plans candidly via voice then getting a plan formulated via that.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach – it sounds like you've developed a clear sense of when to delegate versus when to collaborate based on the nature of the task.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or approaches that have shaped how you integrate these tools?

User: I actually don't have colleagues or a traditional workplace so I can't answer that question exactly. I offer a consultancy service to home service businesses to help optimise their efficiency, create SOP's, legislative compliance, H&S training, automate admin tasks, automate social media etc and free up human hours and reduce risk exposure. I used to work in a home service business so I used that experience to create that business. I also do other stuff such as the newsletter I mentioned the AI agent for and other digital products I sell. I work for myself and don't have employees, colleagues or an office etc it is remotely so no external workplace influence on my AI usage really it is through personal discovery and a desire for optimisation and efficiency.

AI: That context really helps explain your sophisticated approach to AI integration – you've essentially built your entire business model around optimization and efficiency, so it makes sense you'd be experimenting with these tools in such varied ways.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: For frustrated I guess it could be the simple things like memory drift in long conversations, generic phrase usage by llms and their desire to be overly friendly and over affirming of ideas etc and hesitation to be extremely pragmatic and not idealistic, I can't think of a specific scenario or reason I have been frustrated with AI other than generic things that repeat overtime. For particularly satisfied it is anytime it saves me time, The first business report that was created by the agent I made has got to be the most rewarding.

AI: That first automated business report sounds like it was quite a breakthrough moment for you. You mentioned the agent saves you time – what would that task have looked like if you were doing it manually, and roughly how much time does the automation save you now?

User: Well it would have involved reading 10k/10q reports and other company filings, looking at historical financial data, reading the news etc to learn about companies, now I get a list that is worth looking into further, with much of the data and info I need presented for them already via the agent report. I guess the report from the agent saves me probably 3-7 hours a week.

AI: That's a significant time savings – 3-7 hours per week really adds up. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: If AI can take over that area I don't think it is pressingly important to maintain all the skills in that area. If you have skills in an area already that AI can take over I personally think you are now in the position to create systems or products to make that said area more accessible to people that never had skills in that area. It may now be less appealing however to learn new skills in an area AI can take over. I don't think you lose a space in an area you are already experienced due to AI just your position has to change and be prepared to pivot due to AI.

AI: That's a really strategic perspective – seeing AI not as a threat but as an opportunity to leverage existing expertise in new ways.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As AI advances so will my usage of it. If advances plateau my usage will stay the same, if there are leaps in advancement I only see my usage going up. I can't see a situation where I would use AI less.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI creates opportunities to leverage existing expertise rather than replace it, and your strategic approach to choosing when to delegate versus collaborate.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I found your approach to building AI systems around clear criteria while remaining open to suggestions particularly interesting, and your business model really showcases how someone can thoughtfully integrate these tools across multiple workflows.

Have a great rest of your day!
