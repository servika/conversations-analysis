Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good, no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to research medical conditions and symptoms, as well as to find general facts about medications and their uses. I sometimes use it to help calculate dosages of medications.

AI: That sounds like AI is playing a pretty significant role in your medical work. 

When you're using AI for these tasks - whether it's researching conditions or calculating dosages - could you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like? Do you tend to work back and forth with the AI, refining and discussing the information, or do you more often ask it to handle something completely and then use what it gives you?

User: Typically, I will ask a question and then followup questions from there if necessary. So, it is more collaborative.

AI: That collaborative approach is really interesting. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI in your medical practice. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I handle all sensitive tasks myself, but I prefer to use AI for some general guidance. Obviously, I do the hands-on work but sometimes AI can be a useful tool for quick answers and calculations. I rely on my medical knowledge first and foremost, but having AI as a resource-rich tool is helpful.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using your medical expertise as the foundation and AI as a supplementary resource.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or policies around AI use in your medical setting?

User: My workplace culture has become much more digital-based rather than physical, as it was. AI can be helpful at times with repetitive tasks such as charting and spelling. Not everyone was receptive to the inclusion of digital at first, but since then, it has made things easier and less time-consuming.

AI: It sounds like there's been quite a shift in your workplace. The transition from more physical to digital processes, with some initial resistance that's now given way to seeing the efficiency benefits.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There has not been any real frustration with AI, as it has simply been a helpful tool. The satisfaction comes with the ease of helpful information at my fingertips. Also, being able to ask followup questions (for continuity) in having an actual conversation is nice.

AI: That conversational aspect you mentioned is really compelling - having that continuity where you can build on previous questions rather than starting fresh each time.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your medical practice?

User: I do not believe AI will ever be able to take over my work. There is too much human touch that is required for that to be possible. However, in certain aspects, I believe AI could be a helpful aide to people in my profession.

AI: That confidence in the irreplaceable human elements of your work is really clear. You see AI as an aide rather than a replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think the way you use it might change over time?

User: AI is most helpful at my work with accurate, on demand information. Sometimes I need a quick answer and it needs to be reliable. There may come a day when AI could streamline documentation more so than it is now.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a conversational resource that complements rather than replaces your medical expertise, and how your workplace has adapted to become more digitally integrated over time.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so. My work is highly skill-based and personable, so AI hasn't reached very far into it. My using AI is more of a personal choice that is encouraged by our company, but not required. As long as it is helpful and accurate, I will continue to use it.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a reliable information resource while maintaining the essential human elements of medical care will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how you've described that balance between leveraging AI's strengths in information access while recognizing the irreplaceable human skills at the core of your work. Have a great rest of your day!
