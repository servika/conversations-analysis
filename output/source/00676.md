Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: perfect feel free to begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as an engineer and AI is used as an assistant for me. I am unable to input any company data into AI so I have to use it in a more broad sense to help me write segments of code or break down tasks for me.

AI: That's really helpful context about the data restrictions you're working within. 

When you say you use AI to help write segments of code or break down tasks - could you walk me through what that actually looks like? How do you typically approach getting that help while keeping your company data out of it?

User: Say I had a coding task, I would write out the functionality of a function in the code for example and tell the AI to write it. I would then adapt the response so it's perfect as the AI response usually has some errors. I keep company data out by not providing any documents.

AI: That's a clear workflow - describing the functionality and then adapting the AI's output to fit your needs.

When you mention that the AI response "usually has some errors" that you need to fix - what kinds of errors do you typically encounter? Are they logical issues, syntax problems, or something else entirely?

User: Usually logical errors. I think AI often skips small steps or doesn't understand how to write code for electronic systems sometimes.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like the AI might miss some of the nuanced requirements that come with electronic systems programming.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain coding tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones you're comfortable delegating?

User: I do the bulk of the work myself for any project, however for some data handling coding I'm less strong so I use the AI to make a general framework whihc i can adapt

AI: So it sounds like you use AI more as a starting point in areas where you're less confident, rather than for your core strengths.

When you're working on those data handling tasks with AI - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you going back and forth with the AI throughout the process, or do you tend to get that initial framework and then work independently from there?

User: I usually get the initial framewprk and do it myself from there, however i often use the AI for error handling as well.

AI: That makes sense - getting the foundation and then handling the implementation yourself, but bringing AI back in for troubleshooting.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your team has particular attitudes or policies around AI use?

User: It isnt encouraged but is also not frowned upon, all the devices have easy access to copilot

AI: Interesting - so there's kind of a neutral stance with easy access provided. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've felt very frustrated in the past with AI when using it to help program a microcontroller as I feel it often doesn't fully understand embedded systems and tends to overcomplicate communication protocols or not initiate them successfully.

AI: That frustration sounds really specific to the embedded systems domain - where the AI's suggestions aren't just wrong, but wrong in ways that show it doesn't grasp the constraints you're working within.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I always keep on top of all my skills. Although AI might take over, it doesn't always do things correctly so I need to be able to understand how to fix the AI code when it isnt correct.

AI: That's a really practical perspective - staying skilled so you can effectively evaluate and correct AI output when needed.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think your usage patterns might change as the technology develops?

User: I think I'll definitely embrace it more but only to a certain extent as I don't fully appreciate the data security of things put into the AI as a prompt and how secure that data is

AI: That's really thoughtful - balancing the potential benefits with those data security concerns.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experience as an engineer working with AI, especially around the specific challenges with embedded systems and your approach to skill maintenance.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working within data restrictions, the specific challenges with embedded systems programming, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining skills while leveraging AI assistance will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated getting to understand your workflow and perspective. Have a great rest of your day!
