Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I am ready to start

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI to help me research different tools and materials and give me feedback for projects and ideas that I have for creating things (eg wood and metal working)

AI: That's interesting - so you're using AI as both a research assistant and a feedback partner for your creative projects. 

Can you walk me through what a typical research session looks like for you? When you're looking into tools and materials, what kind of information are you usually trying to find?

User: I would be looking for what tools are suitable for the purpose I have in mind, for example if I were cutting steel and wanted to use a bandsaw I would ask AI for advice on the best blade to use and what those specifications mean (eg TPI) and why those specifications are recommended for the material and use I have in mind.

AI: That's a really specific example - getting not just the recommendation but understanding the reasoning behind it. 

Tell me more about the feedback side of things. When you have a project idea, what does that interaction with AI typically look like? Are you sharing sketches, describing concepts, or something else?

User: I will usually just ask for advice, I'll have the idea and outcome but often need help filling in the middle. So if I wanted to create a wooden frame, I would know the dimensions and such beforehand but would use AI to help me identify the best kind of joint for the corner of the frame, whether the frame would require a cross support, what would be the most suitable joining option, etc. It's usually more asking questions to fill in the blanks of my own idea and plans.

AI: So AI is helping you bridge the gap between your vision and the technical execution - you have the creative concept and end goal, but you're using it to work out the specific methods and structural details.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I tend to use AI mainly for brainstorming and advice, as if it were a work colleague to talk to. Although I could get AI to mock up a design, an action plan, instructions, or do calculations for me, I prefer to do all of those things myself and aim to do the bulk of the work and project on my own.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you're making - treating AI like a knowledgeable colleague for consultation rather than as someone to hand off work to.

What draws you to keeping that design work, planning, and calculations in your own hands? What is it about doing the bulk of the work yourself that's important to you?

User: I want to learn these skills thoroughly so that I don't need to rely on others - AI or otherwise - to do them for or with me. I want to upskill myself so that I can be more self sufficient and independent with my tasks.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining your skill development and independence while still leveraging AI as a knowledge resource.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate with AI during the planning phase of my projects, or collaborate and ask for advice if something does not go to plan when carrying out my projects.

AI: So it sounds like AI serves as your planning partner and troubleshooter when things go sideways, but you're doing the actual execution on your own.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself discussing AI usage with others, or is it more of an individual choice?

User: It's an individual choice - my role is relatively niche in my workplace and I don't have colleagues that can help or advise me - I'm also not hugely experienced in the work I do so having an option like AI to turn to to help me learn and fill in the gaps of my knowledge is very useful to me.

AI: That's a really compelling use case - AI essentially filling a mentorship role when you don't have experienced colleagues in your area to turn to.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have used it for project help and have learnt a lot about why certain woods are used for different purposes and how to treat and handle different types of wood when cutting and joining. One thing that has proved frustrating is getting advice on machine maintenance, as AI can give me advice that is not applicable or suitable for the model of machine that I've specified  -for example, telling me to adjust a lever when this particular model does not have a lever on it.

AI: That's a perfect example of both the value and the limitations. It sounds like AI excels at explaining the principles and reasoning behind material choices, but struggles with the specific mechanical details of individual machine models.

When you run into those frustrating moments like the incorrect maintenance advice, how do you typically handle it? Do you find ways to work around those limitations?

User: I typically do the research myself to find an instruction manual online or a youtube video to figure it out on my own

AI: So you've developed a pretty clear sense of where AI's knowledge is reliable versus where you need to verify independently.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think an AI would be capable of taking over my role, as it's a very dynamic and physical role. However, I have to use it for knowledge and information and so I endeavour to learn that all myself so that other people could turn to me for help and advice in future rather than having to use an AI

AI: That's an interesting perspective - building yourself into that human expert role that others can turn to, rather than everyone defaulting to AI for advice.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think the way you use it will change as you become more experienced in your field?

User: I think the only way it will change is that I use it less. As I get more knowledgeable, I'll have less reason to ask Ai for advice and help

AI: That's a really thoughtful progression you're describing - AI as a stepping stone to self-sufficiency rather than a permanent dependency.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about using AI as a knowledge mentor while maintaining your independence and skill development. I particularly found it interesting how you're thinking about becoming the human expert others can turn to.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that covers everything

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a learning partner while building toward independence will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
