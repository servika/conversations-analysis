Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Go ahead.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work as a screenwriter for film and television. "Typical" varies quite a lot in my line of work. The circumstances around one project are never quite the same. However, you could probably categorise it into three buckets: original writing, rewriting, writing for hire. If I'm doing original writing, I will come up with an idea for a story, determine whether it's best suited to TV or film, then start to ideate on story, characters etc, until I have a sense of the overall plot of the feature or pilot/first season of the TV show. I'll then most likely write it on spec and have my agent send it out, rather than try pitching it out. For rewriting (usually film), I will digest the materials that need work, dissect flaws and strengths, how they can be improved, whether I am the right person to do so, and will then pitch my take on what/how to improve the project to the filmmakers involved. If I get the job, I will then try and execute this take, enhancing the script as a whole along the way, in addition to the specifics in my pitch. Usually, there will be at least one revision step where I can adjust/course-correct/inject further feedback from the filmmakers. In terms of writing for hire, I will be interviewed by show-runners, filmmakers etc. based on the strength of my previous work and then be invited to make suggestions or pitch my take on underlying material or ideas. My job will be to serve whoever is in charge of the creative vision, enabling their intentions and, if given the job, helping to execute this vision.

AI: That's a really comprehensive overview of the different types of projects you work on. It sounds like there's quite a bit of variation in terms of creative control and collaboration depending on which bucket a project falls into.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Usually during my own original writing, particularly at an early ideas stage when outlining, I might use AI to say, "Give me ten surnames for a man from Barnsbury born in 1971". Usually, I will not get the ideal response from asking that question, but it will send me on a path towards what I actually want by giving some examples and eliminating what I don't want.

AI: That's interesting - you're using AI more as a starting point or catalyst rather than for the final answer. Tell me more about that process of elimination and how AI helps send you down that path toward what you actually want.

User: Correct. I have found it most useful as a starting point in my own work, it saves me time from searching for inspiration on a broader canvas and instead delivers more quickly the sort of thing I'm looking for. Sometimes its easier to determine what you don't want than knowing exactly what you do; i.e. you probably have a ball-park idea of what you're looking for, but might not be able to articulate it exactly, a sort of "know it when I see it" creative aspect.

AI: That "know it when I see it" aspect is really insightful - it sounds like AI helps you externalize possibilities so you can react to them and refine your instincts. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I used it for generating character surnames in a feature film I wrote. I also used it as a way of iterating idioms, which where part of a joke in a character's dialogue - the dialogue wasn't sounding quite right, or quite as funny as what I was reaching for. Again, the AI didn't give me something better, but by combining and refining its suggestions I was able to reach something I was happy with.

AI: That's a great example of the iterative process you described earlier. When you were working with those idioms for the character's dialogue, what did that back-and-forth feel like? How did you know when you'd landed on something that worked?

User: The back and forth was pretty limited. I asked for iterations based on "bull in a china shop", which it listed. I was then able to hone in on "loose cannon" asking for more like that. I then asked it to generate examples a few more times before settling on which of the examples I thought was closest to my intention.

AI: So it sounds like you had a pretty clear sense of direction - you knew "loose cannon" was closer to what you wanted than "bull in a china shop." When you're working with AI in this way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I don't think I would really describe it as a collaboration, more a more advanced search/indexing, whereas I would consider collaboration to allow some level of independence of thought from the collaborator. As it stands, I am the sole driver of creative decisions, based on years of experience, exposure and personal taste.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - viewing it more as an advanced search tool rather than a creative collaborator. Given that you're the sole driver of creative decisions, what aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this capacity?

User: Rather than wait for inspiration to come to me, I can make my creative process move faster by trying to be more active/targeted.

AI: That shift from waiting for inspiration to actively seeking it out sounds significant. You mentioned you primarily use AI for your original writing projects. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: A lot of people are worried about AI taking away screenwriter's jobs. I am less worried about that. I'm more worried about producers/directors using AI to generate a first draft, then needing a writer to rewrite it to a high-enough quality, while stiffing them on the money they would have received if they had gone though a normal development process from scratch. I suspect AI's presence in writing will create a more homogenous and good/okay base playing field. Ultimately, this will serve to make outstanding screenwriters and original story-tellers more outstanding, provided that of course, it is humans reviewing the scripts, as the post-facto nature of any AI analysis of screenwriting would otherwise mean the importance of originality would likely be downplayed in an evaluative model, as it simply wouldn't have the sample cases to compare it against - think MOONLIGHT or EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE; both are Oscar winners, making significant sums of money across the world, but prior to MOONLIGHT there had never been a Black gay Oscar-winning film, likewise EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE's fusion of martial-arts, sci-fi, familial relationships and 1/2nd generation immigrant culture is without peer.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - you're less concerned about replacement and more about how AI might change the economic structure and evaluation of screenwriting. Your point about originality is particularly striking - that AI evaluation might miss truly groundbreaking work because it lacks precedent to compare against.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think using AI tools to create proof-of-concepts for pitches or even support green-lights/financing/commissioning will become commonplace, helping to lower a sense of risk for people controlling the cash. Without total authorial control over what it is able to generate, I don't see it being able to supplant physical production (real actors on sound stages/locations etc), but I hope it would lower the barrier to entry in what is an expensive and time consuming creative endeavour. I can totally see myself doing a work-in-progress AI generated short/scenes/sequence as a way to sell a project I am working on.

AI: That's a fascinating vision - using AI as a visualization and proof-of-concept tool to help sell projects. It sounds like you see it potentially democratizing the pitching process by making it easier to show rather than just tell.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI might change the economics of screenwriting and your distinction between AI as an advanced search tool versus true collaboration.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, I think that's it.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as an accelerated creative catalyst rather than a collaborator, and your thoughtful analysis of how it might reshape the industry's economic and creative landscape, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
