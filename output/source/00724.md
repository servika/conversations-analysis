Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Hi Claude. Sounds good to me. Let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for a whole host of tasks. For example, I use it for deep research, after which I use that research to develop super deep and comprehensive blogs that rank well on Google. For that matter, I also use it for other SEO tasks. For example, website content and schema markup code development. I will also use it for ideation, almost like an intelligent business partner to bounce ideas off, e.g. paid advertising strategy, web design layout, etc. However, I must stress that for these tasks, I never solely rely on AI; rather, I use AI as an assistant helper/co-pilot.

AI: That's really interesting - you mentioned using AI as a "co-pilot" rather than relying on it solely. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. 

Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: This isn't necessarily the case for me. If AI can help me out, I almost always enlist its help, since it significantly reduces the time I spend on a task, regardless of my "enjoyment." Efficiency takes precedence for me.

AI: That's a really clear perspective on prioritizing efficiency. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: As stated earlier as well, I have more of a collaborative relationship with AI. Frankly, I don't trust it enough yet for it to work independently of me because it can still make mistakes, e.g. a slight factual discrepancy here or there. For example, I use AI to produce a lot of written content, but even then, I check each line with a fine-tooth comb, so to speak, to ensure no errors have been made and so that it follows all instructions perfectly. So, overall, my collaboration with AI involves a lot of manual iteration and back-and-forth discussions with the chatbot before it soundly produces what I want.

AI: That manual iteration and back-and-forth process you describe sounds quite involved. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My workplace has been all-embracing of AI since the very beginning, even with the earliest versions of ChatGPT. We believe that, in many ways, the future, especially within the realm of digital marketing, belongs to those who learn to wield and master the use of AI, be it in more manual, meagre work or grander ideation. So, my workplace culture is all about trying out different AI tools and incorporating them into our workflows to give us an efficiency edge over our competitors.

AI: It sounds like you're in a really supportive environment for AI adoption. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I suppose I feel a mixture of both emotions on a daily basis when using AI. For example, as I said, I use it to produce SEO-optimised blogs. So, in the process, I feed the AI with a number of documents for context and for instruction following reasons. The instructions range from keyword placement, keyword density, tone of voice, structure, etc. So, I feel particularly satisfied when the AI follows all these instructions nearly perfectly on the first or second time of asking. I find myself particularly frustrated when it struggles to follow these instructions, even after going back and forth several times. For example, the AI can especially struggle with internal and external link placement, which takes a while for me to iterate with it. So, ultimately, it is a mixed bag.

AI: That daily mix of satisfaction and frustration really paints a vivid picture of working with AI. The link placement issue sounds particularly challenging since you have to keep iterating on it.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think I would be foolish not to consider this, given the rapid rate of development in the AI industry. We haven't even got to AGI yet! However, ultimately, AI is a tool. It is not proactive. I am the one coming up with the ideas, especially as head of sales, marketing, branding, etc., while AI helps me execute. My job requires a lot of proactive initiative and agency, two things AI doesn't have, since AI has to be prodded. However, even with things like writing, which AI is quickly mastering, I don't see AI ever having the ability to inculcate "human soul" as such into its writing, thereby lacking that deep relatability, which will always require a human to incorporate into it.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on the distinction between AI as a tool versus the proactive human element. You mentioned being head of sales, marketing, and branding - that strategic, initiative-taking role does seem quite different from execution.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As new AI tools keep coming out and keep getting better, I only see my relationship with AI becoming more. It's already quite a key part of my workplace's workflows and procedures. So, as it deepens/improves, my relationship with it at work will deepen/improve.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a tool that requires human proactivity and initiative, and how you've found that balance between collaboration and maintaining oversight through your iterative process.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, that's all good. Thank you, Claude.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative relationship with AI, the daily mix of satisfaction and frustration, and your perspective on maintaining human agency in a rapidly evolving AI landscape will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today. Have a great rest of your day!
