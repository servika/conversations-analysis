Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: None that I can think of.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm mostly a writer, so I go through the common stages, outlining, sloppy first draft, editing, second edit and proofreading. But I also do a lot of video creation: plotting, scripting, editing

AI: That's a nice mix of creative mediums. So you're working across both written content and video production, each with their own distinct stages and processes.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I do use AI in video scripting when I'm doing client videos. I don't use it for my own videos, because I don't feel like it can ever really capture my style. I've tried AI videos for clients, but find them VERY lacking. I usually have to do my own clip finding and change upwards of 90% of the clips every time. In the writing I do under my own name, or my most serious pen name, I would never use AI. It's not good enough, and my writing should be mine. If I ever did integrate it into that process, it would be for research only. But I do have some pen names where I've produced AI books. It takes tons of effort to get something decent out of AI, but it can be done with enough guidance.

AI: Tell me more about that distinction you make between your own work versus client work or different pen names. What drives those different boundaries for you?

User: I feel like my writing has (and should have) a very distinctive style. It's very emotive and visceral, and has a voice. It's my voice. I want it to be my voice. That's the point. People expect a certain level of quality from me, and I would never put my name on something I didn't write myself. But I also want to make money. That's what buys travel and coffee and things I need to live. It's hard to sell any book, so the more books you can put out there, the better your chances of profit. And I know what the market looks like. There are a lot of semi-decent to absolutely horrible books out there, so I don't feel terribly bad about adding AI-written books to that market, especially with the amount of guidance and editing I do to polish them up and make them semi-good. That said, my bestselling book that I wrote myself over 10 years ago still makes me the most money every month. So...? As for client video versus my own, my videos are personal videos that, again, need a personal voice. They are my own footage. They are already original. Clients pay me to create a YouTube channel with X number of videos on it just to profit off of adds or promote their businesses. They provide no footage and no ideas, so it's not really a personal channel. It's just advertising.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way of thinking about authenticity and voice in different contexts. You mentioned that with your AI-assisted books, it takes "tons of effort to get something decent out of AI, but it can be done with enough guidance."

Can you describe what that process actually looks like for you? What does all that guidance and editing involve?

User: I haven't produced a book entirely with AI since last fall, but, at that time, AI was still an absolutely terrible writer. And I tried them all. It always made chapters too short, it was always surface level (no emotion, no depth). So, I might start with an idea of what needs to happen in this chapter. I guess that's where it starts. I don't just tell AI "write me a book about X." I come up with the chapter by chapter outline of what I want to happen first. So, basically, I "write" the whole story plot-wise and then I just let AI expand it. (It's definitely more effective this way).  Typically, I say "This, this, and this needs to happen in this chapter," at which point the AI inevitably just writes those three things in like 500 words. So, then I take a portion of what it writes (if it's good) or tell it what to change (if it isn't), and tell it how to expand it - "this needs to be a longer conversation," "people do generally just chit-chat before they get into a deep topic," "this needs more emotion," "she should be upset here". When it comes down to it, it's probably mostly about telling it how to be a good creative writer - expand this, make it more emotive, the feelings are wrong here. For the last AI novel I wrote, I was able to get a pretty close to polished draft by the end simply by being very demanding during the process. But this took a lot of effort. Often, I was doing only a chapter or even a half a chapter a day. That's almost as slow as writing a book from scratch. But I didn't have to do all the follow-up I do with a normal book (two, three, or four rounds of further editing), and writing takes a lot of brain power, so it was easier.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you're essentially directing the AI scene by scene, almost like a creative director. You mentioned this was "almost as slow as writing a book from scratch" but saved you the multiple rounds of editing afterwards.

When you're in that back-and-forth process with the AI - telling it to make conversations longer or add more emotion - how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what feels like it's driving the creative decisions in those moments?

User: I'm definitely driving the creative decisions. That's the only way to get anything good out of it.

AI: That makes sense. You mentioned you haven't produced an AI book since last fall - what's changed for you since then? Has your approach to using AI in your work shifted at all?

User: No, not really. It's been more of a time issue. I have been dabbling in other types of books. I've been using AI as a researcher mostly lately.

AI: Tell me more about using AI as a researcher. How does that work for you, and how does it feel different from when you were using it for the actual writing?

User: I write a lot of historical things and I like to put a lot of real detail in. I also write books of other types that are based in real life. AI can be very helpful in finding details and stories... when it's honest.

AI: When you say "when it's honest" - what does that look like? How do you navigate that uncertainty when you're relying on AI for research details?

User: I always double-check any "facts" I get from AI. I use it more as a "tell me some stuff I don't know" tool and then I make sure what it tells me is true.

AI: That's a smart approach. So you're using it more as a starting point to discover interesting directions rather than trusting it as a final source.

Looking at everything we've talked about - from the video scripting to the AI books to the research - what aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Sadly, what's changed the most is my motivation to work on original things. It's a lot harder to right something real from scratch, and there's a lot of AI competition out there.

AI: That sounds like a really difficult shift to navigate - losing motivation for the work that feels most authentic to you because of external pressures. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field as you look at where things are heading?

User: I worry about the market being crowded with awful books. But, honestly, that doesn't feel all that new. As soon as Amazon introduced KDP, writers started churning out a book a month to stay in the algorithm, so we've kind of already been on that slippery slope. Readers want books for "free" (as part of their Amazon Prime membership) and authors want to churn out books to make those pennies per read. This will get worse now that even non-writers can churn out a book a month. Same with video. I'm already seeing these ads in games that I play that are clearly AI, and they are so fake and so awful, but it doesn't matter, because they are also mostly free (just the cost of a subscription) for the company to make.

AI: You paint a picture of creative fields already under pressure before AI arrived. It sounds like you see AI as accelerating trends that were already in motion rather than creating entirely new problems.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think your current boundaries and approach will stay the same, or might they shift?

User: I wouldn't say that AI isn't creating entirely new problems. I do worry a great deal about how AI learns creative writing (lifting the voices of popular authors) and artistry (lifting the styles of popular artists). This feels very wrong to me. The only thing I see changing with how I use AI is that I could see doing things I couldn't do before. I have one book series, for instance, that I've always wanted to do a sequel to as a series of graphic novels. AI opens up that possibility for me. But I want to know that I'm not stealing someone else's style when I use it. With my own books and video work, I will never use AI for anything more than research.

AI: Those are really thoughtful boundaries you've drawn, and it's interesting how AI could potentially open up new creative possibilities like graphic novels while raising these ethical concerns about style and voice.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experiences with AI across different creative contexts. I particularly appreciated how you've thought through the distinction between your authentic voice and commercial work, and your awareness of both the opportunities and ethical concerns AI presents.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yes! Not exactly my creative work, but something I was playing around with recently. Those new "styles" type things for images, where you can upload a photo and tell the AI "do this as Picasso" or "do this as anime,' that kind of thing, those are ROUGH. I put in a picture of my half-Indian nephew, who is mid-browned skinned, and asked it to make him a Disney character, then a guitarist, then a construction worker, and it was all good. Then, I asked it to make him a football player, and it literally made him black. Like, I don't know how that factors in here, but whew!

AI: Wow, that's a really striking example of how AI systems can embed and amplify problematic assumptions - in this case apparently associating certain professions with specific racial characteristics. That's definitely concerning, especially when you're seeing it happen to someone in your own family.

Thank you for sharing that, and thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly throughout our conversation. Your insights about navigating authenticity, market pressures, and the ethical complexities of AI in creative work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

User: Cool! Thanks!

AI: You're very welcome! I really appreciate you taking the time to share such thoughtful and candid insights. Take care!
