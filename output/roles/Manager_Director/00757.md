Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, no questions

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I manage a team of Analysts and Program Managers, who are responsible for the technical operations of our business. My day to day typically involves data pulls to find trends and understand how we can be more proactive with our approach to data. I currently utilize ChatGPT and Gemini, but prefer Gemini, as I can directly utilize Google Sheets integration for trending of large amounts of data. I also sparingly use it to reword executive presentations or summaries on said data.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI across different aspects of your management role. You mentioned preferring Gemini because of the Google Sheets integration for trending large amounts of data. 

Can you walk me through what that process looks like when you're doing those data pulls to find trends?

User: Our data currently lives in Tableau and has to be exported to a sheet for analysis. Once exported, I utilize Gemini to find trends and anomalies. I can directly upload the sheet or paste it in and request Gemini to review specific columns or tables of data. An example would be "Determine any trends or anomalies in this contact data in column L". From there, I am able to splice the data and continue requesting trends until we find our anomalies.

AI: That's a detailed process - starting with Tableau, then moving to sheets, and using Gemini to dig into specific columns. When you say you "splice the data and continue requesting trends until we find our anomalies," that sounds like an iterative back-and-forth with Gemini.

What does that conversation with the AI typically look like as you're narrowing down to find those anomalies?

User: The conversation typically begins with me uploading the document and then prompting Gemini to sort the data. 

Some examples would be:
1. Determine any trends or anomalies in this contact data in column L
2. Find any anomalies between these two sets of data
3. Pull all mentions of "X" into a table with counts of each

The prompts vary depending on which type of data I'm looking at, but for the most part, it is contact data to understand technical issues.

AI: Those are very specific, task-oriented prompts. It sounds like you have a pretty systematic approach to how you ask Gemini to analyze the data.

When you're working through this process - from that initial sort through to finding the technical issues - are you mostly giving Gemini complete tasks to handle on its own, or do you find yourself more in a collaborative mode where you're guiding it step by step through the analysis?

User: I think that depends on the ask, but overall I try to let Gemini do the work for me. Sometimes Gemini requires me to do a bit more of the beginning research, but I've found that the more specific the data, the easier time Gemini has.

AI: That's a helpful distinction - the specificity of the data affecting how much initial work you need to do. You mentioned that sometimes Gemini requires you to do more of the beginning research first.

Can you give me an example of when you had to do more of that upfront work versus when you could just hand it off completely to Gemini?

User: When I first started utilizing Gemini, I was uploading sheets with large tabs of information that I would need to manually splice down into tables. I've slowly found that the more direct I am with the data (a smaller dataset), Gemini has an easier time. Overall, most of the upfront work is me or my team, and then once we're able to get it to a suitable place that doesn't confuse Gemini, then we're able to automate our process a bit more.

AI: So there's been a learning curve where you've figured out how to prepare the data in a way that works better with Gemini. It sounds like you and your team have developed a workflow around that.

Are there certain types of analysis or tasks where you prefer to handle things yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Yes, but only because I have to. Any sensitive customer data has to be manually ran or removed before uploading to Gemini. I believe AI should be used for efficiency.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the sensitivity of customer data creates those boundaries. When you say "I believe AI should be used for efficiency," that suggests you have a pretty clear philosophy about when and how to use it.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others on your team using it similarly, or do you see different approaches?

User: Yes, absolutely. Our organization was recently required to complete an "AI in the workplace" training, which outlined various ways we can integrate AI into our work. There are a few different approaches, depending on the team, but the majority of us utilize AI to sparse data to save time.

AI: Interesting that your organization formalized AI training. It sounds like data analysis is a common use case across teams, but you mentioned there are a few different approaches depending on the team.

What are some of the other ways you've seen your colleagues using AI that might be different from your data-focused approach?

User: A few of my colleagues utilize AI in a more simplistic way, such as creating or rewording emails, creating presentations, or asking for creative ideas.

AI: That's a nice contrast - the more analytical data work versus the communication and creative tasks. You mentioned earlier that you also use AI sparingly to reword executive presentations.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I don't often find myself frustrated with AI, but when I do, its typically because it is not understanding my prompt or vision. Often times, it can be a me issue but there are times where AI is not understanding or getting caught in a loop from something I've said previously. The majority of the time I am satisfied, even if I have to make small tweaks to wording, because the overall time savings is worth the try.

AI: That's a practical perspective - weighing the time savings against the occasional need for tweaks or clarification. You mentioned AI sometimes getting "caught in a loop from something you've said previously."

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, it's something I consider. I think if you're not considering it, you're foolish. AI is the future, whether thats automation or simplification. I've considered taking a few courses through IBM or similar to understand better ways I can utilize AI that I may not have thought of.

AI: That's a forward-thinking approach - actively seeking out ways to expand your AI capabilities. It sounds like you see this as an evolving skill set rather than something to avoid.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this going for you and your team?

User: Looking ahead, I would like to automate as much as I possibly can to allow us to focus on other things that AI cannot handle, such as collaboration with other teams. I encourage my team to utilize AI in all things they do every day.

AI: That vision of using AI to free up time for the distinctly human work like collaboration is really clear. It sounds like you're actively encouraging that mindset across your team too.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've refined your approach to data preparation to work better with AI, and your philosophy about using it for efficiency while being mindful of skill development.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope! Thank you!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the iterative process of learning to work with AI, the importance of data preparation, and your forward-thinking approach to automation will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
