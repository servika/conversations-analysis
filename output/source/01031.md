Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In my current role I use it several times a week for two main types of tasks: communication and writing code. I will generally use it to draft messages (email or Teams) for me so that I can make sure I don't come across too arrogant or too soft--I want to be direct and clear. This means either I have it edit it what I wrote, or completely draft something new based on constraints I provide. The other task is writing code. Similarly, this is sometimes me offering code and seeking solutions/refinement or me asking for code for a very specific problem.

AI: That's really helpful context. I'm curious about the communication side - when you mention wanting to strike that balance between not being too arrogant or too soft, can you tell me more about what that looks like in practice? 

What kind of situations typically prompt you to turn to AI for help with your messaging?

User: When I'm writing an email that will get sent to the team, as well as to the boss and the boss's boss, I need the writing to strike a balance between "corporate professional" to appease management, but also to not be too stiff or informal so I can win over the team. I don't want to be judged negatively by either group, and it's a fine line to walk.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - navigating those different audiences in one message sounds tricky. 

When you're working on those multi-audience emails, do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI to refine the tone, or does it typically nail that balance on the first try?

User: About 50/50. Sometimes it produces something I'm extremely impressed by on the first try, often when I ask for it to be written in "corporate speak." Other times if I just provide the intended audiences, it doesn't pick up on the subtle nuances of navigating a mixed group.

AI: Interesting - so the more specific you are with terms like "corporate speak," the better it performs. 

Shifting gears a bit, I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are times when I write a chunk of code and it won't execute. I'll spend a few minutes, sometimes longer, reading through it all to try and find my error. It would probably be faster to ask AI, but there's an esoteric quality to hunting for a miniscule error in lines of code that has just derailed the entire program. And, once you've found it, it's a huge dopamine hit--victory! It's like one giant puzzle I've created for myself.

AI: That's a fascinating insight - the puzzle-solving aspect and that dopamine hit when you find the bug yourself. It sounds like there's real satisfaction in that process, even when it might be less efficient.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'm far more likely to collaborate with it on a task.

AI: Tell me more about that. What does that collaboration typically look like when you're working through something together?

User: The collaboration is entirely born of errors. Either I'm not asking the question correctly, or haven't been specific enough. Or the AI hasn't found the correct answer, or hasn't understood me correctly. So, there is often a back an forth, with me refining or rephrasing my question.

AI: That's really insightful - so the collaboration emerges from that iterative process of getting on the same page. It sounds like you're both working toward mutual understanding.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: None of my colleagues use AI, I'm not sure they know what it is. As far as workplace culture, we get mixed signals. They want us to use Copilot within Teams, but then it doesn't work. They encourage AI use and are promoting it while a vendor works on a chatbot, but then they send out a list of "ten banned generative AI sites." They want people excited about it, but they aren't preparing them for it, and they're sending mixed signals.

AI: That sounds like a pretty confusing environment to navigate - being encouraged to use AI while also getting warnings about banned sites. 

Given that mixed messaging, how do you decide what's okay to use AI for at work and what isn't?

User: They're pretty direct that we can't submit any PII or STI or FTI, which is a given but it's good they say it. They give examples that it's ok to ask for help writing an email but don't give specific information contained in the email, etc. I have more knowledge than the average person about how AI works as well as information security, so I feel comfortable making decisions about what to use it for.

AI: That makes sense - your background gives you confidence to navigate those boundaries. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustrated -- sure! I was trying to do some really silly formatting in Power BI. I wanted some space between columns in a visualization. It was a very lengthy iterative process to first ask the right question, and then to get AI to understand my data enough to provide a solution without risking any issues with privacy. I spent a couple hours on that, and trying the solutions it kept providing unsuccessfully so many times was exhausting and incredibly frustrating. But we got there in the end, sort of.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - spending hours on what should have been a simple formatting task! When you say "we got there in the end, sort of" - what was the final outcome? Did you eventually get the spacing you wanted, or did you have to settle for something close enough?

User: I find with most code I need to "finesse" or "massage" it a bit. That was the case here. I had to do further research on online forums to smooth out some issues. Even then, I had to settle for "close enough" and use white rectangles to block out the labels of the "dummy spacer columns."

AI: That's a perfect example of how AI collaboration can be both helpful and limited - getting you partway there but requiring your own problem-solving to finish the job.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: AI has helped me sharpen my critical thinking skills about specific problems, so I can ask the right questions. It's also helped me learn new code and new techniques for approaching problems. I think these are better skills to have than memorizing code. It frees me up time to think and research, which frankly is a better use of my time.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - viewing AI as a tool that enhances your higher-level thinking rather than replacing your skills. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope to use AI to collaborate further on higher-level thinking projects. I am less interested in memorizing exact coding languages but more interested in how I can use a certain type of code to solve a specific problem. I'd like to refine that to apply to my specific tasks/data so that it's a faster process with fewer iterations.

AI: That vision of moving toward higher-level strategic thinking while AI handles more of the technical implementation sounds really compelling.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has actually sharpened your critical thinking skills and freed you up for more strategic work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not at this time.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating workplace AI policies, the collaborative nature of your interactions, and how you're thinking about skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
