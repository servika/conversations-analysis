Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good to me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure. I work as a comedy writer, content writer and script writer. Sometimes I need help with brainstorming ideas or concepts. I will use AI to give me a variety of different concepts and ideas.  I might give the model a script and ask it to help break down scenes into beats. I also write kids fan fiction, so I ask AI to help me with creating quirky characters and defining their characteristics. I also might need to double check a book I have written for continuity errors.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across such a creative range of writing projects. When you mentioned brainstorming ideas and concepts, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? How do you usually interact with the AI during those brainstorming sessions?

User: It depends really on each project I am working on. For some things like getting ideas, I might ask for a list of examples or concepts based on a set of instructions. Other times, I will provide something I have worked on and ask for help. For example, if I was writing about an action scene for the kids book, I would ask how to make it more vivid and suspenseful for my young target audience.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: When I write anything related to humor or adding humor, I typically like to make up the jokes but that's only because humor usually comes from being a little random. I also like to draw from my own personal life experiences in writing, that I feel make my writing style a bit relatable. AI can help with these but my personal flair and humor is important in my writing.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - humor and personal experiences really do seem like they'd be uniquely yours. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I usually like to stick to collaborating because I like to check over everything however I will sometimes provide complete tasks to save time for me, for example, checking a 1000 word chapter or script for any continuity errors or plot holes.

AI: That's interesting - so you're making strategic choices about when to collaborate versus when to delegate based on the nature of the task. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you work independently, or are there others around you who are also using these tools?

User: I work independently and I typically have to teach myself new things about using AI to help me. Sometimes I find it a little overwhelming as there is just so much information out there about AI. It feels every day there are new AI functions, features, companies, apps, I don't know what's best really.

AI: That sounds like a real challenge - trying to keep up with all the new developments while also figuring out what actually works for your specific writing needs. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was working on a skit for a client based on a brief idea they gave me. Initially I felt the script I made was ok but I wanted to give it a real professional touch with tips on camera shots, dialogue etc. The AI really helped guide me on this, and the finished product was great.

AI: That's a great example of AI helping you elevate your work to that professional level. It sounds like that collaboration really paid off.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I feel I should learn more as AI grows but I haven't put too much thought into it. I am unsure where to start really.

AI: That uncertainty about where to start makes complete sense given how fast everything is moving.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? What do you think that might look like for you as a writer?

User: I feel it could lead to more productivity. If I am able to make the AI imitate my style and tone and humor, I can create better drafts potentially.  It may lead to helping me become even more creative too.

AI: That's a really intriguing vision - the idea of AI learning to imitate your unique style and humor to enhance your creativity rather than replace it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI as a writer. I particularly appreciated your perspective on keeping humor and personal experiences as your own creative domain while strategically using AI for things like continuity checks and professional polish.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing creative control with strategic AI collaboration, especially in such a personal field like comedy writing, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I hope you find some clarity on where to start with learning more about AI tools as they continue to evolve. Best of luck with your writing projects!
