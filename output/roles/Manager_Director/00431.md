Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No Questions, lets go!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure. I work as a chef/kitchen manager so a lot of my use of AI is in admin or back of house uses. I use it to help me with a variety of tasks there such as rostering, stocktake and ordering and helping to write emails or other contact, generally with suppliers. Occasionally I do also use it to help brainstorm creative ideas or what to do with certain ingredients, but mostly I use it as an admin tool for now.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into the business side of your kitchen operations. 

When you mention using it for rostering and stocktake, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How does the AI help you with those specific tasks?

User: For the rostering it is fairly simple, I just get the AI to assist me in working out everyones availability and how that might work into a roster for the week to make sure all the shifts are covered. I also might have certain preferences for who works at a particular time, so the AI can take that into account too. As for the stocktake and ordering, I can use the AI to help save me time with recording the stock, by talking to it as I check levels, and then help it to advise me what I might need to order based on the current levels.

AI: That's a really practical way to use AI - essentially having it as a conversational assistant while you're doing the actual work. 

When you're talking to the AI during stocktake, are you literally speaking out loud to it as you're walking around checking inventory levels? How does that interaction work in practice?

User: Yeah, I literally speak to it while I am walking around. Usually I am doing this when noone else is around so its not an issue. I can then either get the AI to feed the numbers directly into a spreadsheet or table, or just have it take notes for me and then use the data afterwards.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that voice interaction while you're moving around the kitchen must be much more efficient than stopping to type everything.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I feel pretty comfortable with using the AI for jobs that are more administrative, although I will always check things afterwards for rosters or important ordering. I think I feel like when the tasks are very important or can affect other people (such as the ordering) I need to be responsible for the task and check it personally myself. Given my work involves a lot of creative and intuitive work, the roles I use AI for can be limited by that, since it can't obviously taste or smell things itself. I generally see it more as an assistant and time-saving tool rather than relying on it fully for those reasons.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - it sounds like you've developed clear boundaries around what feels appropriate to delegate versus what needs your personal oversight.

When you do use AI for brainstorming creative ideas or working with ingredients, how does that collaboration typically unfold? Are you bouncing ideas back and forth with it, or using it more as a starting point for your own creativity?

User: It can vary a lot depending on the needs I have. I prefer to be able to develop the creative process myself, but I may use the AI if i get stuck, say with a particular ingredient I'm not sure what to do with, or when I have various things i need to use and I'm not sure how to use them together. It can also be useful for when I do have an idea but may need some suggestions of how to execute the idea. So really it varies a lot depending on the situation. Sometimes it can be helpful to trigger the creative juices when I'm a bit lost, or otherwise it can allow me to worry about the creative side more while it helps to give practical ideas on how to execute things.

AI: That flexibility sounds really valuable - using AI as either a creative spark or a practical execution partner depending on what you need in the moment.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others in your kitchen or restaurant use it as well?

User: I tend to be the one using it the most, since I have a small team and I am generally responsible for a lot of the tasks Ive already described. Its actually not something I have discussed a lot with other staff members, so I'm not sure if they use it for anything beyond basic uses.

AI: So it sounds like you've kind of pioneered this approach on your own without much discussion about it with your team.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think the most satisfied I have felt when using AI at work has been on a couple of occasions when I have used it as a creative tool to try and work out ways to use a lot of left-over ingredients that I was having trouble getting rid of, and finding ways to use them together. The ability for the AI to make some suggestions or find other peoples uses of the ingredients that I would not have immediately though of was extremely helpful. Because I tend to use the AI as a secondary tool for work, and often as something to bounce off, I generally don't get too frustrated with it directly.

AI: That sounds like a really satisfying way to reduce waste while being creative - getting those suggestions you wouldn't have thought of yourself must feel like a great collaborative moment.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Its not really something I worry about too much in my industry. Given the reliance on physical human skills as well as creativity, I can't see any threat from AI in the near future. For the time being I see it as a generally positive tool in my industry, as it allows me to focus on the things that I consider more important and which also happen to be the aspects of my work in which AI is unable to have a use.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective - it sounds like the physical and sensory aspects of cooking create a natural boundary that lets you use AI as a complement rather than a replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or are you pretty settled in your current approach?

User: For the time being I am pretty happy with the approach I have, AI works well for me as a collaborative tool, and I don't really require much more out of it. I could see it getting better as a creative tool as its knowledge expands and improves, but generally I think it will always need human oversight or input for it to be useful in the workplace.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI fits naturally into the administrative side while leaving the sensory and creative aspects of cooking firmly in your hands.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really. I think industries that do rely on some aspects of creativity such as mine certainly can have a use for AI, but there are aspects that I can't see it taking over from humans anytime soon. It has a lot of uses but a lot of them are fairly basic in the scheme of things, although extremely useful in saving time and helping to streamline more mundane tasks in the workplace.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a practical assistant while maintaining the creative and sensory aspects of your craft will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've found that sweet spot of using AI to handle the administrative work so you can focus on what makes your role unique as a chef. Thanks for the great conversation!
